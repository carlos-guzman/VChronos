{"course_name": "East/West? Politics of Cultural Representation and the Middle East", "description": "Scholars have argued that since the \u201cfall\u201d of Byzantine Constantinople to the Ottomans in the 15th century, Western European intellectuals started framing cultural difference in terms of the \u201cEast\u201d and the \u201cWest.\u201d Renaissance humanists, for example, resorted to ancient and medieval texts to create a religiously and culturally defined \u201cother\u201d\u2014the \u201cOttoman Turks.\u201d Their writings then spread around Europe and generated conceptualizations of what the West \u201cought to be,\u201d as different from the East.\n\nThis course will examine a wide variety of cultural representations pertaining to the modern Middle East that have contributed to the configuration of \"East/West\" divides, such as: the World Exhibitions of the 19th and early 20th centuries; novels; discourses and institutions of humanitarianism; and the contemporary human rights regime. We will explore politics of cultural representation over the last two centuries and how they lend themselves to problematic interpretations of the East/West in general, and the Middle East in particular. Sources to be examined include historical pamphlets, old newspapers, film, travel accounts, and fictional works by authors such as Hanif Kureishi, Tayeb Salih, or Orhan Pamuk.\n\r      ", "classification": "AHSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "Open to sophomores and above; preference to CAS students.", "instructors": ["Igsiz Matos Martin, Zehra"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "216", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "25W4 C-2", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "What is Memory", "description": "The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as \u201cHow is memory embodied?\u201d How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self--and with language and story-telling-- and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students will come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that will serve their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. This course will count as an advanced elective towards the English major.\n\r      ", "classification": "AHSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "Open to sophomores and above; preference to CAS students.

{"course_name": "Making Art in the Anthropocene: Project on Ecology, Species and Vibrant Matter", "description": "\u201cEither stop writing, or write like a rat!\u201d In one of the most provocative texts in contemporary animal philosophy, the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari famously propose \u201cbecoming animal\u201d as a liberating artistic practice. This workshop-cum-seminar will engage with key themes in recent \u201cpost-humanist\u201d discourse by applying and testing them in our own creative practice. We will read recent theories of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors, Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear, and Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo). Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space, objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic implications of these theoretical ideas. A main interest of this course is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making as well as by thinking/writing/speaking. Prior artistic training/practice is welcomed but not required; however, all students must be willing to and interested in exploring their \"inner artist.\"\n\r      ", "classification": "AHSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "Open to sophomores and above; preference to CAS students.
