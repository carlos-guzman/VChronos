{"course_name": "War and Media in the Middle East", "description": "This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies \u2013 including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet \u2013 are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.\n\r      ", "classification": "ACS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Tawil Souri, Helga", "Tawil Souri, Helga"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "233", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": "2 10/27/20", "end": "- 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "X\n\r   Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages", "description": "This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur\u2019an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.\n\r      ", "classification": "ACS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Cohen, Mark", "Cohen, Mark"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "206", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
