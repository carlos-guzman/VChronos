{"course_name": "Capstone Research Project | Senior Capstone Research Project", "description": "The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project. Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.\n\r      ", "classification": "ARTS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '7.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Levine, Debra"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "400", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
