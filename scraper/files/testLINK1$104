{"course_name": "Time", "description": "This course explores the multifaceted nature of time, in different historical, social and religious contexts.  We will pursue three main strands: 1) changing conceptions of time, time-keeping systems, and states of time consciousness from antiquity to the present; 2) representations of time in works of art that heighten our apprehension of time and its vertiginous quality or aim to escape the rule of time and induce a quality of timeless suspension; and 3) the technologies of time-keeping from sundials to atomic watches, calendars to timelines.  Denaturalizing our own conventions of keeping time, we will consider the purposes of time measurement, the history of the hour, the development of the mechanical clock and its impact on society, the relationship between clock time and industrialization, the shift from local to international standard time, and the question whether the human experience of time is common across cultures or is culturally specific and variable.\n\r      ", "classification": "COREA-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '11.45 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '11.45 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Ballon, Hilary", "Ballon, Hilary"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "44", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": "1 08/31/20", "end": "- 10/23/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

This interdisciplinary course examines what rhythm is and how it manifests itself in a wide variety of domains that range from music and the visual decorative arts traditions spanning cultures across the globe and throughout history, to how it emerges in, and is informed by, areas such as mathematics, computer science, music theory, music technology, biology, psychology, linguistics, sociology, evolution and human migrations, ethnology, crystallography, nuclear physics, calendar design, radio astronomy, architecture, computer graphics, and the visual arts. Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm. They discuss progress on their projects during the term, and present their results to the class at the end of term.

This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, we will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. We will study writings by Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, and Rosi Braidotti, artworks by Andrea Zittel, Lucy Orta, and Krzysztof Wodiczko and cinematic works including Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes.

Through an analysis of the history of image making, writing, printing, photography, the telegraph, radio and television, the course will consider the process through which the uses of such new media are recognized, how they are celebrated and criticized, and what they have made it possible to say and think. In the background, as these histories are analyzed, will be similar questions about the swarm of recent communications technologies loosely known as the Internet.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present.  The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the  laments  and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.  Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso,  Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among  others.\n\r      ", "classification": "COREA-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Bravo, Gwyneth", "Bravo, Gwyneth"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "43", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
