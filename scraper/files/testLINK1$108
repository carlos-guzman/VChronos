{"course_name": "Capstone Research Project", "description": "The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken both semesters of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students refine a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and undertake research and/or creative work. In the tutorial, students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director to hone their research and produce successive drafts of a capstone project. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the work and defense before a faculty panel.\n\r      ", "classification": "HUM-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '7.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Klimke, Martin"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "400", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
