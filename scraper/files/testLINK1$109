{"course_name": "Problems and Methods of Literary Studies", "description": "This course develops students\u2019 understanding of the central questions and problems that drive literary studies. Drawing upon a long history of theoretical approaches, the course considers such questions as: What is literature? What is a text? What does a literary critic or scholar do? What does it mean to read literature in translation? How does language shape meaning? How do we construct meaning from a text\u2014and why does that meaning matter? And, crucially: what is at stake in why we ask and how we answer these questions? This class will engage these questions by reading widely, from primary theoretical and critical texts to examples from print and digital material, and by exploring particular practices of literary scholarship\u2014from archival research to work in digital humanities\u2014that offer necessary skills for effective critical practice.\n\r      ", "classification": "LITCW-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.35 PM', 'end': '4.50 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '3.35 PM', 'end': '4.50 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Williams, Katherine", "Williams, Katherine"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "105", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
