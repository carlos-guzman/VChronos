{"course_name": "Pirates, Privateers & Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean", "description": "Pirates, privateers and runaways of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century Caribbean fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. Today, the Jolly Roger --the pirate flag-- is clearly displayed in toys and makes for compelling cinematic moments. In real life, however, flying that flag was a criminal act punishable with the death penalty. How must we think of Francis Drake, the most feared privateer of the 1500s, in the age of Jack Sparrow, the most renown of the fantasy pirates of our days? This class will approach the history of maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might otherwise escape scholarly inquiry. While outsiders often described pirates and privateers as renegades, godless, murderers and villains, privateer men like Francis Drake, pirate women like Anne Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at the very center of important political questions of their age. Students will read academic books such as Villains of All Nations, by the historian Marcus Rediker, as well as original documents dating back to the age of piracy.\n\r      ", "classification": "FRSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '12.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Perez Morales, Edgardo A"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "538", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "UHAL C02A", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time\u2019s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week.\n\r      ", "classification": "FRSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Clements, Marcelle"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "503", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "SILV 512", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted.

This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?\n\r      ", "classification": "FRSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '12.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Carrasco-Queijeiro, Marisa"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "497", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "MEYR 551", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly.

If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education, McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur.

{"course_name": "Global Citizenship: Theory & Practice", "description": "The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.\n\r      ", "classification": "FRSEM-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Baer, Ulrich"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "484", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "WAVE 431", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
