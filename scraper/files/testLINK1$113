{"course_name": "Foundations of Peace: Psychological Perspectives", "description": "This class will introduce students to the foundational theoretical approaches to peace from a psychological perspective. The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest, violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.\n\r      ", "classification": "PEACE-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '2.00 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '2.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Henry, Patrick", "Henry, Patrick"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "101", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "International Organizations and Global Governance", "description": "The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today\u2019s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations\u2019 origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today\u2019s international system.\n\r      ", "classification": "PEACE-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Harsch, Michael", "Harsch, Michael"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "121", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Transitional Justice", "description": "How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.\n\r      ", "classification": "PEACE-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.35 PM', 'end': '4.50 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '3.35 PM', 'end': '4.50 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Abdulkadir, Rahma", "Abdulkadir, Rahma"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "120", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
