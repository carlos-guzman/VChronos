The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors.

What explains the variation in the types of regimes\u2014democratic and authoritarian\u2014\nacross South Asia? To what extent do these countries vary in the structure of their states as well as regimes? How does ethnic diversity affect the politics of South Asian countries? What is the pattern of economic growth across these\ncountries, and their human development record and why? What explains the high levels of violence in some South Asian countries and patterns of\nvariation across these countries? These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region,\nthe primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions\u2014and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.\nRecommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150)\n\r      ", "classification": "POLSC-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course is equivalent to POL-UA 562 Comparative Politics of South Asia.", "instructors": ["Brule, Rachel", "Brule, Rachel"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "153", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
