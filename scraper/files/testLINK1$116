This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.\n\r      ", "classification": "SCIEN-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '2.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Recitation", "number": "113", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": "2 10/27/20", "end": "- 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "2", "is_open": true, "section": "REC2"}
