{"course_name": "Information Societies", "description": "Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.\nWe will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.\n\r      ", "classification": "CCST-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Core Curriculum requirement: Science \u2013 Science, Technology and Society.\n\nThis course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): STS.\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.

{"course_name": "Serendipity in Science", "description": "In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.\n\r      ", "classification": "CCST-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.30 PM', 'end': '5.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Core Curriculum requirement: Science \u2013 Science, Technology and Society.\n\nThis course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): STS.\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.

{"course_name": "Animals, Nature, Environment", "description": "This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of \"nature\": how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.\n\r      ", "classification": "CCST-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Core Curriculum requirement: Science \u2013 Science, Technology and Society.\n\nThis course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): STS.\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.
