{"course_name": "Introduction to International Politics", "description": "What are the causes of war?  Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not?  What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system?  This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions.  Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us.  The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required.  Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.\n\r      ", "classification": "SOCS-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '1.45 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '1.45 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Core Curriculum requirement:Social Perspectives on China.\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.

{"course_name": "Media and Participation", "description": "Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.\n\nThis course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere. \n\nThis course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.\nThe class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.\n\r      ", "classification": "SOCS-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '11.15 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies an elective for the following Majors:  HUMN; IMA\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.
