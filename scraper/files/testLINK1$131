{"course_name": "ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, & BIOPHYSICS I", "description": "Anatomy and Physiology are the sciences that identify body structures and how they function and interact, respectively. Therefore, academic training for biomedical engineering must include a sound, comprehensive knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. While the course emphasizes normal functions, it also considers the consequences of disease and injury and deals with the body's potential for recovery and compensation. The Biophysics' component examines the underlying physical principles of organ function. Part I of this two-part sequence focuses on Cell Physiology and Homeostasis, Cardiac, Nervous, and Respiratory systems. The course will be taught using a \"systems engineering\" approach and introduce the design considerations for artificial organs. The material includes hands-on demonstration of technology to measure EEGs, EKG and respiratory function. | Prerequisite(s): Calculus, biochemistry, introductory gross and cellular anatomy.\n\r      ", "classification": "BE-GY", "grading": "Grad Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.30 PM', 'end': '5.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Di Resta, Gene"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6103", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/19/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "A"}
