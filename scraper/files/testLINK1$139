The works that will be addressed reject impressionistic, subjective commentary. The beauty of word or artifact is not applicable. Post-1900 non-referential sculptures and paintings will be juxtaposed with poems that disassociate themselves from narrative content, poems whose only subject matter is language configuration \u2013 even when there is apparent thematic material \u2013 poems of Robert Creeley, John Ashbery, Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Amy Clampitt, Susan Howe, Michael Palmer, Clark Coolidge, and Louis Zukofsky. The poets so listed complement preoccupations of artists such as Mark di Suvero, David Smith, Richard Serra, Anthony Caro, Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Vito Acconci, Robert Smithson, and Marcel Duchamp. | Prerequisite(s): Completion of first year writing requirements\n\r      ", "classification": "EN-UY", "grading": "Ugrd Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.30 AM', 'end': '12.20 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '10.30 AM', 'end': '12.20 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Nadler, Alan", "Nadler, Alan"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "3144", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "A"}
