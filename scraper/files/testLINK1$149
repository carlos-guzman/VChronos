{"course_name": "W\n\r   Critical Studies in Digital Art", "description": "This course will introduce students to the historical, technological, and\nphilosophical milieu that contextualizes and composes the creative use of digital technology. The course will be (1) delving into the history that is the foundation for our current context, (2) contemplating the theoretical implications for technological cultural production, (3) comparing the differences between analogue and digital art that are sometimes subtle and sometimes blatant, and\n(4) considering the complexity of defining personal expression in light of the technological, social meshwork that is the digital domain. As a result, digital art will be considered in the context of technological art and its history and implications. | Prerequisites: Completion of first year writing requirements.\n\r      ", "classification": "MD-UY", "grading": "Ugrd Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '8.30 AM', 'end': '10.20 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '8.30 AM', 'end': '10.20 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "4164", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "A"}
{"course_name": "Interactive Narrative", "description": "This course introduces students to the complex relationship between interactivity and storytelling. Students analyze how an interactive structure creates narrative. Works explored in this course range from nonlinear novels, experimental literature, audio narratives, theater/performance to film as narrative databases and games. The study of the structural properties of narratives that experiment with digression, multiple points of view, disruptions of time, space, and storyline is complemented by theoretical texts about authorship/readership, plot/story, and characteristics of interactive media. | Prerequisite: Completion of first year writing courses.
