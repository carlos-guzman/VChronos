{"course_name": "Urban Public Transportation Systems", "description": "This course provides a thorough understanding of policy, planning, operational and technical issues that affect urban public transportation. It includes the historical development of cites and the rise of urban transport. Also covered are the characteristics of various urban transportation modes (their specific operating and infrastructure characteristics), as well as key elements that are critical to service provision, such as service planning, scheduling, fare collection, communication and signaling, station design and customer service. The course offers a broad perspective on regional planning, capital programming and policy matters. Special focus will be on emerging technologies and their practical applications. | Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.\n\r      ", "classification": "TR-GY", "grading": "Grad Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.30 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Bata, Andrew"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "7133", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "BKLN"}
{"course_name": "ADAPTIVE CONTROL, SIMULATION, AND SOFTWARE", "description": "This course introduces software used in various transportation analyses, traffic simulation and signal optimization software.  The course covers SYNCHRO, software for creating optimal signal timings and progression offsets, as well as performing a capacity and level of service analysis of signalized intersections in accordance with the Highway Capacity Manual.  Also covered is the use of the AIMSUN simulation program to analyze a traffic network.  The course will focus on the theory behind the programs, as well as on practical examples of how to optimally use each package.  Applications will include analysis of adaptive control systems and implementations. | Prerequisites: TR-GY 6333 and TR-GY 6343 or equivalents; or permission of advisor\n\r      ", "classification": "TR-GY", "grading": "Grad Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.30 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Xin, Wuping"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "7353", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/19/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "BKLN"}

{"course_name": "TRANSPORTATION & TRAFFIC CONCEPTS, CHARACTERISTICS & STUDIES", "description": "The course covers basic concepts in transportation and traffic engineering, including:  volume, demand, and capacity; traffic stream parameters and their meaning; transportation modes and modal characteristics.  The impact of traveler and vehicle characteristics on traffic flow and on other modes is presented and discussed.  The importance of data collection is emphasized with sample studies, such as volume, speed and travel time, and safety.  Capacity and level of service analysis for uninterrupted flow facilities, including freeways, multilane highways and two-lane highways is demonstrated using methodologies of the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual. | Prerequisite: Graduate standing or permission of instructor\n\r      ", "classification": "TR-GY", "grading": "Grad Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '6.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '6.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Patel, Raman", "Patel, Raman"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6333", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/19/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "BKLN"}
