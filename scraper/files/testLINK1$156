{"course_name": "Global Public Policy Analysis", "description": "Only open to Executive MPA students.\n\nThis course provides students with foundational analytical tools that facilitate their ability to understand the interactions among various interests, institutions, ideas and individuals in the policy-making process. It prepares students to disentangle the dynamics of power and politics throughout the policy process at three distinct levels: at the national level in the U.S. and other OECD countries, in the \"developing\" country context, and at the transnational level. We examine the dynamics of agenda-setting, framing, the role of analysis and evidence in the policy process and the rise of \"evidence-based\" policy; the role of deliberation and transparency; insights from behavioral economics and social psychology on regulation and incentives; how social movements and advocacy organizations influence the policy process; the role of street-level bureaucrats; and the relationship between evaluation, learning, and policy change. The emphasis throughout is on mixing the development of conceptual and analytical tools with diverse, context-rich case studies and classroom exercises aimed at developing a real world proficiency in policy analysis.\n\r      ", "classification": "EXEC-GP", "grading": "Grad Wagner Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Gershman, John"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2202", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Robert F.

{"course_name": "Institutions, Governance, and Public Sector Reform", "description": "Only open to Executive MPA students.\n\nThis course exposes students to contemporary thinking about institutions, governance and the reinvention of the public sector. We focus on specific reforms intended to improve government performance and promote good governance as rapid economic, political and social changes-both global and local-- evolve in different countries at various stages of development. Major topics include establishing and enhancing rule of law, property rights, and regulatory regimes; developing more effective organizational structures, civil service systems and anti-corruption mechanisms; and creating and enhancing frameworks and policies for public sector fiscal management, decentralization, public-private partnership and citizen engagement. As we work through the topics, we consider competing theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. An underlying theme is the need to go beyond the mainstream tendency to use pre-packaged tools and narrow frameworks in pursuit of single \"right\" answers. Rather, the course uses diverse case material to challenges students to use rigorous and creative analysis to seek levers of change that matter and are feasible in particular contexts.\n\r      ", "classification": "EXEC-GP", "grading": "Grad Wagner Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.20 PM', 'end': '1.55 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Gershman, John", " Smoke, Paul"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2201", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Robert F.

{"course_name": "Continuous Quality Improvement for Healthcare Leaders", "description": "Only open to Executive MPA students. \n\nThis course is designed to explore the complex organizational mechanisms that need to be in place for the delivery of world-class service. While many organizations understand the importance of service, the ability to consistently deliver on this service often eludes them. This is especially true in healthcare organizations.  Customer service is the end product, the outcome of a well-oiled machine that has the infrastructure, the staff, and the will to deliver on that service. It requires exquisite synergy among key organizational components: human resources - leveraging recruitment, selection, training, empowerment, coaching, recognition staff for service delivery; organization and systems design - implementation of an organizational structure that facilitates service delivery using customer-focused processes and systems; and the deliberate creation of a service culture that permeates all segments of the organization regardless of role, rank, or function in the organization.\nThis course will cover a broad range of service delivery topics including: defining service excellence, aligning core organizational and human resource systems for service delivery, seeing service from the customer\u2019s perspective, improving systems and service, service failure and recovery, and benchmarking best practices in world class service organizations.\nIn addition to providing you with an understanding of current issues in service excellence, a second objective of this course is to develop your skills in applying these concepts. To do this, business cases, classroom exercises and assignments will provide individuals and groups an opportunity to practice analyzing and solving actual service problems. It is my intention that you leave the course with an expanded toolkit that can be applied to your work contexts as well as being better informed about organizational dynamics that impact customer service.\n\r      ", "classification": "EXEC-GP", "grading": "Grad Wagner Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '8.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2811", "loc_code": "OC", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Robert F.
