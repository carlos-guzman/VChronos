Often the development of the idea brings improvement or change to existing processes or products. Sometimes the result is so radically different it creates something new that did not exist.  Innovation has been at the heart of human development from the very beginning when fire was harnessed and the wheel was conceived. Innovative thinking has helped people evolve from self-reliant survivors to participants in the global community.  An entrepreneur plans a new business based on an idea, manages it, and assumes the risks of growing it, with the intention of earning a profit.  The entrepreneur needs to plan for every business function including, but not limited to: planning processes, staffing, raising funds, marketing, and assuring good financial practices and reporting.
