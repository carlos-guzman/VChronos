{"course_name": "Understanding Media", "description": "This course introduces key concepts and theories in media studies and analyzes a wide range of contemporary popular media genres, such as movies, talk shows, news programs, soap operas, children's programs, and advertisements. Students develop a holistic understanding of how U.S. media systems work; how media messages are encoded with ideological assumptions; and how audiences generate hegemonic and counter-hegemonic readings of media text. Students learn to apply media theories to everyday media experiences and develop the competency to research, write academically, and gather information through alternative media sources.\n\r      ", "classification": "MEST1-UC", "grading": "UC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "FALL 2014 - NO CLASS 10/14/13 - FALL BREAK", "instructors": ["Sun, Chyng-Feng"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6028", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/16/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Cultural Identities in The Media", "description": "This course explores the concepts of identity from multiple disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, gender studies, and critical race theories, and then focuses on the role mass media plays in the construction of cultural identity. Students will investigate both the macro and micro levels of the interaction of media and identities. At the macro level, we will look at how media reflect, perpetuate, and reinforce (but also challenge) social forces such as economics, politics, and laws concerning the social categories (such as race, gender, class, and sexuality) that affect individuals. Using theories and empirical research from audience reception, we will also examine, at the micro level, how audiences interpret, appropriate, and incorporate media representations in their construction of self. Students will study key notions and theories of cultural identities and develop a nuanced understanding of media influence, particularly the tension between media hegemony and personal agency.\n\r      ", "classification": "MEST1-UC", "grading": "UC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '8.50 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "FALL 2014 - NO CLASS 10/13/14 - FALL BREAK", "instructors": ["Sun, Chyng-Feng"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6006", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/08/2014", "end": "12/15/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "194M 208", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
