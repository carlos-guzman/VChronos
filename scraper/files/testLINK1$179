Specifically, an organization?s product positioning should be consistent with the overall positioning of the organization itself, and both communications initiatives should flow from the core principles the organization stands for (for example, a commitment to the marketing of quality products).  So, if those core principles are not sound, and if they are not communicated consistently to internal and external audiences, performance and reputation will suffer, as the spate of recent scandals demonstrated.  While a good reputation cannot be built, or at least sustained, unless the organization does good things, reputation is a function of communication as well as behavior ? so both have to be managed consistently and well.

So, if those core principles are not sound, and if they are not communicated consistently to internal and external audiences, performance and reputation will suffer, as the spate of recent scandals demonstrated.

{"course_name": "Reputation Management", "description": "Organizations interact with various stakeholder groups, both internal and external, and the interactions challenge organizations to consider who they are and how they represent themselves. In other words, organizations are, or at least should be, concerned with issues of intrinsic identity (what they stand for) and reputation (how they are perceived). This course examines how to manage identity and reputation as assets so that, over the long term, they will contribute to the growth and viability of the organization, as significantly as any asset might. The course also examines how identity influences the ways in which organizations represent themselves to the various constituencies, and how identity is influenced by interactions with the groups. While a good reputation cannot be built, or at least sustained, unless the organization does good things, reputation is a function of communication as well as performance and behavior\u2014so all three have to be managed consistently and well. In combining theoretical foundations with a case-study approach, students will be encouraged to examine issues of identity, representation and reputation critically and analytically. The case study approach will include organizations with the best and worst reputations. Among the organizational reputation cases examined in class will be: the Apple iPhone 4 problem; BP oil spill in the gulf, Pepsi syringe hoax; Firestone-Explorer tire crisis; Prudential insurance fraud; General Motors Dateline NBC Truck Explosion controversy; and the Toyota recall. We will examine organizations with exceptionally strong intrinsic identities including Starbucks and the Mayo Clinic.

So, if those core principles are not sound, and if they are not communicated consistently to internal and external audiences, performance and reputation will suffer, as the spate of recent scandals demonstrated.

{"course_name": "Research Process & Methodology", "description": "This course affords the student the opportunity to thoroughly explore the areas of public relations and corporate communications as they relate to business. Research is a complex undertaking with formal processes, methodologies and design.

To do so, s/he must be fully cognizant of acceptable research techniques, data collection, research design, internal and external validity and statistical methods for hypothesis testing. This course equips the student with the required research skills that are necessary to successfully conceptualize a research topic. Upon completion of the course, students are expected to have learned: how to conduct a literature survey, the hallmarks of scientific research, the hypothetic - deductive method, how to develop a theoretical framework, data collection methods, analysis and interpretation, and how to evaluate a research report. Students will also be introduced to methods for correctly citing references and quoting other works without plagiarizing, infringing upon copyright or violating the rules governing proprietary information.

But out of these scandals have come laws and regulations (from Sarbanes/Oxley to securities regulations and guidelines governing disclosure of information about publicly traded companies) that have put organizations and the people who speak for them at greater peril.
