Peer support services are designed and provided primarily by peers who have gained practical experience in both the process of recovery and how to sustain it. In this course, social work students will learn how to promote and integrate peer support services based on the premise that a crucial factor in helping people move along the recovery continuum is social support. Peer support services may be offered at different stages of recovery: services that precede formal treatment which can strengthen motivation for change; services that accompany treatment provide community connection during treatment, and services that follow treatment, support and sustain recovery.\n\r      ", "classification": "MSWEL-GS", "grading": "Grad Silver Pass/Fail", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.00 AM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "COURSE ONLY MEETS ON 9/26/14 & 10/10/14.\nCourse meets at ICL corporate office, 125 Broad Street, 2nd Floor Training Room.", "instructors": ["Videka, Lynn"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "3060", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/26/2014", "end": "10/10/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Silver School of Social Work", "location": "OFFC ", "units": "1", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
