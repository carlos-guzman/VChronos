The focus is on the transactional relationship between human behavior and pertinent psychological, social, biological, economic, cultural, environmental, and institutional forces. Multiple theoretical perspectives are used to understand the behavior of individuals, families, groups, social networks, and systems. The role of social stressors such as poverty and oppression and their impact on human development are evaluated. All aspects of development and behavior are studied in the context of diversity. The life cycle stages of infancy and childhood are also viewed from a biopsychosocial perspective.\n\r      ", "classification": "MSWPF-GS", "grading": "Grad Silver Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.45 PM', 'end': '8.25 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Arthur, Darren"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2006", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Silver School of Social Work", "location": "1WSN G13", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "006"}
