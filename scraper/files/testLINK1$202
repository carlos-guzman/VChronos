{"course_name": "Cities and Their Environments", "description": "The course focuses on recognizing &amp; assessing the complex interrelationships between the city &amp; its environment.  The central problem is the alienation of urban residents from their surrounding\n environments.  Different frameworks for integrative analysis of human-environment relationships are used\u2013from human ecology to geography to resilience. The intent is to re-conceptualize the city in\nways that make these phenomena explicit, &amp; to communicate this to multiple publics.  Students will also learn to conduct a quick sustainability assessment of a local neighborhood and develop a\n communication plan for it.\n\r      ", "classification": "ENYC-GE", "grading": "Grad Steinhardt Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.45 PM', 'end': '8.35 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Lejano, Raul Perez"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2005", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Graduate", "location": "TISC LC1", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
