This seminar will work to develop a theory about failure, not as a measurable feature of various human projects and tools, but of the experience and languages of failure. Much of life, for must of us, is a series of failures. Our public life consists of failed states, failed markets, failed wars, failed diplomacy and failed technologies. Much of the story of invention and innovation is the story of failure, as is much of the story of business and big engineering. Yet failure is not the same as error, mistake, disaster, catastrophe, misfire or accident.  Failure is not a technical fact but rather a narrative and only takes its meanings in the ecology where global standards encounter local idioms and ideologies. Failure is inevitably about language, communication and mediation and thus efforts to talk about failure often also fail. This seminar uses a variety of examples from urban planning, the study of social movements and social studies of finance to examine the ecology \u2013 and anatomy \u2013 of failure as a social construction.", "instructors": ["Appadurai, Arjun"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "3130", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Graduate", "location": "TISC LC1", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Departing from the exhibition and museum site as an object of study, this course examines the modern history of visual display. The artistic avant-garde radically altered the way we look at visual display by eliminating the separation between image and audience. Nevertheless, this visual \u201crupture\u201d has been echoed in the contemporary discussion about public art and the role of cultural institutions. Since the 1920s, political regimes in Russia and Europe intervened in exhibition techniques connecting avant-garde with totalitarian art \u2013 a fact that reinforced the ideological function of the museum. How do museums and contemporary art institutions use the ideological function of the museum display now? How do they create the ideology, which as Guy Debord, theorist of the spectacle noted, conceals the truth of the society that produces it? Does the notion \u201cpublic art\u201d adequately express the avant-garde desire for the full integration of viewers in the process of exhibiting the artwork? Is there a space for resistance to the ideology of \u201cspectacle\u201d and corporate economy around art inside the modern art exhibition?", "instructors": ["Kopenkina, Olga"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2400", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Graduate", "location": "KIMM 808", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
