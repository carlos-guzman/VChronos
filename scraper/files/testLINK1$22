Is it a transparent window? Or is it a more complex form that may include elements of staging and fiction? In Brazil (as elsewhere) the last twenty years have seen a surge in documentary filmmaking and critical thinking about this kind of film. The increased production of documentary film is part of the Retomada or Renewal of Brazilian cinema of all kinds since the 1990s, made possible by favorable government policies.  This course, CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH, will examine a selection of these Brazilian films from the 1990s to the present (with brief retrospectives to earlier films) and explore issues such as: the uses of fact and fiction and the multiple ways in which documentary film may go beyond offering realistic versions of preexistent realities; the scope of its political impact; ethical concerns about the respectful use of other people's images and words; the construction of layered and complex images of Brazil.  Readings concern these and other aspects of documentary films. \n\nReadings for the course are available in one or more of the following ways: for purchase at the NYU Bookstore or online (amazon.com or elsewhere), posted on NYU Classes, or at Bobst library.  The films are on reserve at the Avery Fisher Film Library at Bobst. \n\nCOURSE OBJECTIVES:  This course is designed to introduce students to diverse aspects of Brazilian culture and to documentary film as a genre, while developing their critical thinking skills.", "instructors": ["Peixoto, Marta", "Peixoto, Marta"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "706", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "ARC_ LL04", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

These stories, ranging from the autobiographical to the distinctly fictional, and even fantastic, will allow us to consider the multitude of purposes which the strategy of first-person narration can serve and to observe how these apparently self-centered narratives can represent broad aspects of Brazilian culture and often convey a sharp critique of Brazilian society. \n\nAs a complement and contrast, we will also view and discuss three films narrated in the first person (Cidade de Deus, Tropa de Elite and Jogo de Cena) \n\nThe students will write three short papers, two will be analyses of first-person texts discussed in the course, and the third may be, for those who want to try a creative writing project, a first-person narrative of their own composition.", "instructors": ["Peixoto, Marta", "Peixoto, Marta"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "830", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "GCASL 374", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
