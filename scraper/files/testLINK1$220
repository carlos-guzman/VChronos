{"course_name": "Science Curriculum and Teaching Methods", "description": "This year-long course integrates a study of secondary science curriculum and science teaching methods.  Important aspects of curriculum theory and design for secondary science are introduced through four case studies of theories driving curriculum development (e.g. Man: A Course of Study), assessment and curriculum (e.g. School of One), culturally responsive curriculum (e.g. the small schools movement), and international assessment and accountability (e.g. Trends in Math and Science Study (TIMSS) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)).  These case studies will also provide the context for examination of science methods such as lesson planning, classroom management, and multimedia/technology integration.\n\r      ", "classification": "SCIED-GE", "grading": "Grad Steinhardt Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '4.00 PM', 'end': '6.35 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Milne, Catherine"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2420", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Graduate", "location": "EAST 403", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
