{"course_name": "Art: Practice & Ideas", "description": "'Art: Practice and Ideas' examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create and reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting and sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, and computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, and postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, and technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical and social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time.\n\nLiberal Arts Core/MAP Equivalent - satisfies the requirement for Expressive Cultures\n\r      ", "classification": "ARTCR-UE", "grading": "Ugrd Steinhardt Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '4.05 PM', 'end': '7.25 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "meets with LIBAR-UE 941", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "10", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Undergraduate", "location": "BARN 105", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
