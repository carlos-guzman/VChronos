We focus on indigenous histories and contemporary struggles in each location. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we will develop a rich comparative hemispheric study of colonialism, power, and the deep cleavages within societies that produce important forms of resistance and vital social mobilizations for justice. While these geographic spaces may appear to have nothing to do with each other, upon closer examination we will learn how to compare colonialism, genocide, class exclusions, and the aesthetic and cultural projects of social resistance. My teaching goal is to help you acquire and articulate a unique hemispheric and global vantage point on the operations of race and racism.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world.\n\nComprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage.\n\nThis course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s.\n\nWe will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent.\n\nToday, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing.\n\nWe will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.

In what ways do communities develop collective memories? In what ways do counter-memories emerge? Accordingly, begin by exploring \"the past\" in West Africa, the ancestral home of most African-Americans in the United States, but we continue the course by asking: what memories of Africa are cultivated or suppressed? Likewise, we ask how experience of slavery in the United States is constituted as a past, remembered and forgotten. Our goal is to achieve a solid grounding in 18th and 19th century African-American history, and to develop conceptual tools for making a complex analysis of the past and of the politics of memory.

This course will survey and critically explore an historical range of black films in relation to the modern city, as an inspiration, as a setting, and as a site of political contestation and cultural production. We will screen, discuss, read and write about a sampling of important black independently made, and/or black cast and narrative feature films, such as Juke Joint, Killer of Sheep, Bush Mama, Stormy Weather, Soul Food, Do the Right Thing, Paid in Full. Accordingly, our discussions and readings will cover the full range of issues and debates current in black cinema studies, from independence vs. mainstream filmmaking; gender and sexuality; class and color caste; the bourgeois wedding flick: ghettoization and mobility of urban environments, and so on.
