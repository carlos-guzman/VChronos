{"course_name": "Anatomy of Difference", "description": "This course looks at how difference is constructed in film through reading assignments, in class screenings and critical analysis of full-length features including main stream Hollywood, independent, and international films. This inquiry will take note that while some of these films may be conventional in form, in content they challenge accepted notions of differences, or stereotypes. Our goal is to catalog films that resist accepted notions of the \"other.\" To accomplish our goals we will deal primarily with textual analysis that focuses on story, character, as well as cinematic space and time. With the help of the required texts we will examine socially accepted notions of the \"other\" and see how they are derived and or challenged in and by films, thus looking at how an art form can interact with socially accepted forms of \"othering.\" The objective of the course is to train emerging artists and scholars to engage in critical analysis that can make profound contributions to the individual's unique creative or analytical process. Another intention of the course is to delineate and occupy the space left for debate between authorship as expressed from a directorial perspective from authorship from the spectator's point of view.\n\r      ", "classification": "ASPP-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '5.30 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Antonio, Sheril"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2020", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "721B 6FL", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Art and/as Research Ways of Knowing", "description": "This class will concentrate on research methods of art making.  It has been argued that creativity has seven stages: orientation, preparation, analysis, ideation, incubation, synthesis, and evaluation. Each of these steps will be explored and researched with complimentary writing assignments and individual or group creative problem solving exercises.  These seven steps of creativity will be a platform to structure the class and hopefully come to understand the mystery of inspiration, originality and invention.  We will examine other related theories such as trauma and creativity, spontaneity, chance, creativity as a voice for empowerment and the function of freedom and lack of freedom to heighten artistic movement.  How are we inspired?  Is there a method to our creativity?  Can the creative process have a formula?  How does research inform the creative process?  The class will utilize the archives, galleries and libraries as a research tool and NYU as research University.  We will visit the Fayles library, the Tainamont library, NYU Grey Art Gallery as well as visit with scholars and artists to consider the furthering of ideas into a series of stages to a final project and paper.\n\r      ", "classification": "ASPP-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.00 AM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "Email emily.brown@nyu.edu for permission to enroll.", "instructors": ["Finley, Karen"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2023", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "194M 303", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

How have artists understood the city itself as material, content, creative convergence? While we will look at artistic projects from various global urban contexts, New York City will serve as a primary ongoing site for reference, investigation and engagement. New York will be explored through the work of essayists and fiction writers who have taken the city as subject. We will also direct and make regular excursions into the surrounding urbanscape to shape our creative practices.

Performing and communicating the body: gender, race and identification.  Awareness of work in progress, process, such as text, script, online and improvisation will be utilized. The visual aspect of performing:  such as accessories, design and costume. Listening, finding voice and giving and taking commands, and deviation from dominant norms of entertainment and product.  Hopefully with deeper understanding, we will seek to challenge and stimulate our own creative content to produce original, thought provoking performance.

{"course_name": "Issues in Arts Politics", "description": "This seminar aims to give students both a conceptual and practical grounding in the range of issues and approaches by which arts politics can be understood. We will think about the complexities that lie between the politics that make art and the politics that art makes?which is to say the array of forces that give rise to specific artistic practices and the agency and efficacy of artistic work. The course will be framed by the following considerations: What are the institutional, discursive, and ideological contexts that shape the objects, images, sounds or texts we call ?art?? What are the links between cultural spaces-- the museum, the movie-theater, the gallery, the music/dance hall, the bookstore, the fashion runway, the public street, television, cyber space-- and the larger realm of politics? And how do these relationships impact, implicitly or explicitly, the ways we create, curate, or study the arts? How do consumers play an active role in the reception of artistic products and practices?  What is the relation between formally promulgated cultural policy and the tacit knowledge that artists call upon to get their work into the world? What dimensions of the broader cultural terrain are made legible through artistic practice? What are the means through which art intervenes in the political arena? ?Art? will be studied as a site of contested representations and visions, embedded in power formations-- themselves shaped by specific historical moments and geographical locations. Given contemporary global technologies, cultural practices will also be studied within the transnational ?travel? of ideas and people. Such germane issues as the legal and constitutional dimensions of censorship, the social formation of taste, the consumption of stars, the bio-politics of the body, transnational copyrights law-- will all pass through an intersectional analyses of gender, race, class, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and nation, incorporating the insights of such areas of inquiry as multiculturalism, feminism, postcolonialism, and queer studies. Each session is organized around the exploration of a key term, with readings that develop conceptual and practical issues. Art examples will be shown in class.\n\r      ", "classification": "ASPP-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '12.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "SAME AS PERF-GT 2312.

{"course_name": "Art & War Seminar:", "description": "Art and War: Battle Lines of the Graphic Novel\nThis course explores storytelling about war through the use of the graphic novel. Students will be introduced to both recent and historically significant comics about war. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between image and text in sequential art, the fundamentals of graphic novel development, and the ability to critically analyze graphic novels that deal with challenging subject matter. What are the ethical and methodological issues that arise when constructing sequential narratives of war? Are there differences between war narratives that are autobiographical, documentary or fictional? Is there something unique about the format of graphic novels that enables artists to tell a different kind of war story than filmmakers, musicians or performers? How do comic books circulate culturally, and how might this expand or limit their ability to inform our understandings of war? We will explore these questions through close readings, robust discussions and careful written analysis of well-known works by Art Spiegelman, Marjane Satrapi and Joe Sacco, as well as graphic novels by Keiji Nakazawa, Mira Kirshner, Jason Lutes, J.P Stassen, Gipi, Emmanuel Guibert and others.\n\r      ", "classification": "ASPP-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "Art and War: Battle Lines of the Graphic Novel", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.05 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "SAME AS ASPP-UT 1046.", "instructors": ["Hebert, Patrick"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2046", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "GCASL 384", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
