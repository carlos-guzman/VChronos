The take away at the end of the course will be that each student is able to clearly view themselves as an individual enterprise ready to segue way into their desired field in the entertainment business. \n\nINVESTOR RELATIONS (.02):\nThis class will concentrate on shaping and pitching project presentations to film and non-film industry investors.
