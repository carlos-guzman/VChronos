{"course_name": "Live Web", "description": "The World Wide Web has grown up to be a great platform for asynchronous communication such as email and message boards. More recently this has extended into media posting and sharing. With the rise of broadband, more powerful computers and the prevalence networked media devices, synchronous communications have become more viable. Streaming media, audio and video conference rooms and text based chat give us the ability to create content and services tailored to a live audience. During this course, we focus on the types of content and interaction that can be supported through these technologies as well as explore new concepts around participation with a live distributed audience. In this course, we look at new and existing platforms for live communication on the web. We leverage existing services and use Flash, PHP, AJAX and possibly Processing/Java to develop our own solutions. Experience with ActionScript/Flash, PHP/MySQL and HTML/ JavaScript are helpful but not required.\n\r      ", "classification": "ITPG-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Pass/Fail", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.10 PM', 'end': '2.40 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Van Every, Shawn"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2734", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

{"course_name": "Materials and Building Strategies | Materials and Making Things by Hand", "description": "You've built a foam prototype. Your project idea is now out in the open sitting on a table where you and your teammates can look at it. It's not quite what you thought it would be when you made your first rough sketch, there?s even something a little goofy about it, but then there's also that interesting curve that you hadn't envisioned. Your teammates have also noticed some things that you hadn't thought of. You see where you can reshape the foam to make the prototype both look and work better. You've made your first step; you've moved your project forward. Removing barriers to creative problem solving and learning the steps for advancing a project are the dual purposes of this course. You're asked to make things over and over during your time at ITP. This class helps you to break out of 2-d screen and keyboard thinking and take advantage of the discoveries that inevitably occur when you're thinking in 3-d by manipulating materials with your hands, observing the results, and refining successive iterations of your idea. From techniques for prototyping and making small objects to fabrication methods for kiosks, you'll get hands-on experience with a variety of materials and methods. You have an idea for a wearable device? Mock it up with the sewing machine. You're thinking about a squeezable children's toy with sensors? Make a mold and cast some sensors inside soft rubber. You want to build an installation? Make a foam core model of the space and get a valuable preview of your project installed. During the course you'll be introduced to building in a variety of materials. You?ll make objects of wood, foam, plastic, metal, clay, plaster, rubber, paper and fabric. You'll move a project from sketch to prototype to presentation and learn to incorporate the lessons of the process into your final product. By taking notice of the unexpected your original concept will evolve, and amplified by those revelations it will surprise you and delight your audience.\n\r      ", "classification": "ITPG-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Pass/Fail", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.30 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO MAJORS ONLY.", "instructors": ["Menderson, Peter"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2025", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

There are required weekly meetings to share project development and obtain critique. Students must devise and then complete their own weekly assignments updating the class wiki regularly. They also must present to the class every few weeks. When topics of general interest emerge, a member of the class or the instructor takes class time to cover them in depth.

{"course_name": "New Interfaces for Musical Expression", "description": "The course focus is on the design and creation of digital musical instruments. Music in performance is the primary subject of this class. We approach questions such as \"What is performance?\" \"What makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?\" and \"How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?\" Over the semester, we look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance - such as novice versus virtuoso performers, discrete versus continuous data control, the importance of haptic responsiveness as well as the relationship between musical performance and visual display. Extensive readings and case studies provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance. Students design and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, algorithm for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. A technical framework for prototyping performance controllers is made available. Students focus on musical composition and improvisation techniques as they prepare their prototypes for live performance. The class culminates in a musical performance where students (or invited musicians) will demonstrate their instruments.

{"course_name": "Understanding Networks", "description": "Interactive technologies seldom stand alone. They exist in networks, and they facilitate networked connections between people. Designing technologies for communications requires an understanding of networks. This course is a foundation in how networks work. Through weekly readings and class discussions and a series of short hands-on projects, students gain an understanding of network topologies, how the elements of a network are connected and addressed, what protocols hold them together, and what dynamics arise in networked environments. This class is intended to supplement the many network-centric classes at ITP. It is broad survey, both of contemporary thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods used in creating them. Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent). Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not all, production work in the class requires programming and possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well. Possible topics include: * topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few workable ones there are, and how there's no topology so stupid it isn't in use some place. * addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why the phone network and the internet differ even though they use the same wires * protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs * scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push systems * a discussion of security and its effects Possible exercises include: * Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware versions * Client-server programming * A group protocol/messaging exercise * An HTTP/RESTian model exercise\n\r      ", "classification": "ITPG-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Pass/Fail", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.20 PM', 'end': '5.50 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO MAJORS ONLY.", "instructors": ["Igoe, Thomas"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2808", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
