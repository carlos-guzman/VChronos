Iran Arts Activism addresses this challenge by utilizing social media as an online platform for contact and exchange with artists and curators of Iran's blossoming grassroots media art movement. This introductory course is as much about learning the transformation of art and society in contemporary Iran and its 20th-Century genealogy as it is about investigating and producing an activist \"relation\" with and creative knowledge about a country with over two and a half millennia of literary tradition and the recent modernist expression that bespeaks collective trauma of centuries long territorial and imperial struggle, the 1953 CIA-MI6 coup d'\u00e9tat, the 1979 revolution and 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, which has nevertheless lead to a thriving young population with universal aspirations and in continuous contact with a diaspora in flux throughout the world. We discuss theories of art activism and media art in context of geopolitical history. More importantly, we visit a wide range of aesthetic expressions such as classical and modern poetry, 1950s USIA educational titles, filmfarsi comedy/melodrama, New Wave experimental, documentary, and fiction films, 1960s and 70s television pop music and modernist paintings, revolutionary propaganda murals and posters, bank notes, poetic Iran/Iraq war documentaries, 1980s and 90s child/art films, and post-90s classical and pop music and trace their transformations in diaspora. The format of the course dovetails theory, history, and curatorial practice and includes in-person and Skype guest visits by artists, curators and academics. The course is structured around group projects, online assignments, museum and gallery visits, journal reports, short paper and final presentation. In addition to in-class screenings, students are encouraged to complete viewing some film and music videos on their own and incorporate their sensorial experience toward hybrid artistic and curatorial re-appropriations.

{"course_name": "Topics in Recorded Music:", "description": "Variously referred to by such luminous titles as \u201cthe hardest working man in show business\u201d and \u201csoul brother number one,\u201d James Brown may well be the most important figure in 20th century recorded music. His thrilling stage and recorded performances starting in the late 1950s helped elevate expectations for soul music. And in the 1960s he became the chief innovator behind funk music, creating the singing\u2010and\u2010dancing template that inspired later\u2010day luminaries like Michael Jackson, Usher and Justin Timberlake. In addition to his multi\u2010decade chart successes and his major contributions to the soundtrack of the civil rights movement (\u201cSay It Loud, I\u2019m Black and I\u2019m Proud,\u201d for instance), Brown excelled as an entrepreneur, emerging as one of the first African\u2010Americans to own his own record label and retain control of his publishing income. This unique course will investigate the early career of James Brown and the changing musical and sociopolitical context of the 1950s and early 1960s that informed his celebrity. Students should walk away from the course with a more sophisticated understanding of one of the great musical innovators in the history of recorded music and a greater sense of how those innovations tied into changing musical field and identity politics of the latter half of the century.\n\r      ", "classification": "OART-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "James Brown", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '3.30 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "Open to all undergraduates.

{"course_name": "History of Documentary Film", "description": "The course traces the documentary film from its origins to the present day.  Pioneer documentarians like Dziga Vertov and Robert Flaherty saw in documentary film the ability to portray life with a kind of truthfulness never before possible.  Early Polish filmmaker Boleslaw Matuszewski wrote that while \u201cthe cinematograph does not give the whole truth at least what it gives is unquestionable and of an absolute truth.\u201d  Since those heady days, it has become all too clear that documentaries have no special access to the truth. Nevertheless, as this still-young art evolved, documentarians of different schools constantly sought new means to tell the human story. Documentary filmmaking has always been a blend of artistry and technical means and we will also explore this critical relationship.  \r\n\r\nThe course explores the development of the documentary and the shifting intentions of documentary filmmakers through the evolution of narrative approach and structure paying special attention to the documentary tradition\u2019s relationship to journalism. Students examine how different filmmakers have gone about trying to convey \u201creality\u201d on screen both through the use and avoidance of narration, through interviews, editing and dramatizations.  \r\n\r\nThroughout the semester, students investigate how image-driven medium attempts to report stories and the ways an emotion-driven art can be problematic for journalistic objectivity.  Finally, the ethical and journalistic responsibilities the documentary filmmaker are discussed.  Special attention is given to dramatic re-creations, the filmmaker\u2019s relationship to his/her subjects and the construction of narrative through editing.\n\r      ", "classification": "OART-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.20 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Open to all undergraduates.", "instructors": ["Dorman, Joseph"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "1701", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "25W4 C-2", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
