{"course_name": "Introduction to Performance Studies", "description": "This course is an introduction to the field of performance studies. In this course, performance will be broadly construed to include aesthetic performance (performance art, theater, music, dance, and visual culture) and everyday presentations of self. We will study the history of the field and its relation to other fields (anthropology, theatre studies, philosophy, dance studies, feminism, political science, critical race theory, legal studies, etc.) and ask questions of how the study of performance can help us to understand contemporary questions of aesthetics, politics, and social culture. We will study the theory and history of the field as grounded in documented performances in addition to attending live performances in New York City. This course will place particular emphasis on political performance (in the US and abroad), queer, and minority performance.\n\r      ", "classification": "PERF-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Nyong'o, Tavia"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "101", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Performance Studies: An Introduction with Richard Schechner", "description": "This hybrid course introduces students to the fundamentals of Performance Studies. In this flipped classroom model, students will be dedicating their time to both online learning (online learning modules that replace lectures, and online activities and assignments), and once weekly face-to-face class sessions where they will be able to more deeply explore the content and questions raised from the online component. The purpose of this course design is to target the following competencies: communication (written and oral), critical and creative thinking, collaboration, sociocultural and historical understanding, self-awareness, and peer review. * This course counts as an elective towards the Performance Studies major/minor.\n\r      ", "classification": "PERF-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Mee, Erin"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "200", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "721B 612", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Race and Performance", "description": "This semester, the course will consider various forms of performance (including performance art, visual art, sound art, literature, politics, and performance of everyday life) by artists of color to think about belonging and alternative forms of world-making. This course will ask: what difference might it make to think of race as performative? How might the analytic of performance equip us in this course to identify and enact anti-xenophobic strategies for everyday practice? We will explore these questions through engagement with cultural texts, including scholarship in critical ethnic studies, queer of color critique, and affect studies.\n\r      ", "classification": "PERF-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '6.15 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Rodriguez, Noel"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "203", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Gender Performance", "description": "Gender and Performance introduces students to the question of how gender identity is performed. Performance will be broadly construed to include aesthetic performance (performance art, theater, music, dance, and visual/sensorial culture), everyday presentations of self, and performative relations to space, time, species, politics, media, and popular culture. We will ask, in particular, how performance correlates with the expression of gender, feminism and sexuality.
