It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be designing for the web. Content can take center stage. Advances in web browsers and standards, and smart thinking allow us to finally embrace web design as its own thing.

Modern websites can be intelligently malleable projects\u2014adaptable and responsive to a broad continuum of uses and devices from 27\" screens to your iPhone. Responsive web design allow sites to gracefully adapt to any number of circumstances. These recent advances can seem overwhelming to keep up with: HTML5, CSS3, responsive web design, mobile, web fonts and grids. It seems impossible to keep up with everything. Does your content travel well? Can your design and functionality survive from one platform to another or one browser to another? This class will take it slowly.
