The goal of the class is to excite and engage students in the limitless world of sound for the moving image by involving the students in most aspects of track design for film and television. In class, students create sound designs for an in-class project and then in workshops this design is brought to the screen. These class workshops focus on looking at the material to see what the appropriate sound design is and determining its many components. The workshops cover: the spotting session, FX recording, stereo ambiance recording, the Foley artist, the FX library, digital editing and mixing, and the nuts and bolts of sound editing.  Students must have locked picture at the beginning of the semester for the final project. The emphasis is really on the bigger picture on using the track to expand the narrative and the visual.
