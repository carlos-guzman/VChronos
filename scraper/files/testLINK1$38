{"course_name": "Urban ICT and City Operations", "description": "This course provides an overview of the role of information and communication technologies in urban operations and introduces students to the full range of urban domains and their interactions. Specific attention is given to energy and building efficiency, transportation, public health and emergency response, waste, water and wastewater, and connectivity and how urban informatics can be used to improve operational and resource efficiencies. In addition, principles and metrics for urban resilience are presented. The role of civic engagement and community participation in the context of open data and citizen science is explored, as well as the evolving relationship between, and influence of, informatics on urban governance. Top-down and bottom-up models of innovative service delivery are discussed and debated in the context of public decision-making. Economic and cost-benefit analysis techniques are introduced with methods to evaluate alternative infrastructure investments and risk scenarios. Case studies and best practice examples are used extensively.\n\r      ", "classification": "CUSP-GX", "grading": "CUSP Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.30 PM', 'end': '5.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Kontokosta, Constantine"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "5002", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Ctr for Urban Sci and Progress", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "002"}

It explores a systems approach to the operation and growth of cities and describes emerging frameworks for a scientific theory of how a city works.

Topics include spatial growth models, scaling and size distributions, networks and flows, entropy in urban systems, and an introduction to spatial interaction models. Specific applications of urban models to domains, such as transportation and sustainable development, are provided, together with empirical examples.
