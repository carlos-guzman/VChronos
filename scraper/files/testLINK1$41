{"course_name": "Writing Fiction in the Digital Age", "description": "The main goal of this course is to provide students with ways how to enhance traditional storytelling by new technologies without diminishing the role of the written word. We will examine every aspect of the craft of traditional fiction writing: plot, structure, point of view, narrative voice, dialogue, building of individual scenes, etc as well as the new techniques of the digital age: hypertext, visual and audio images, social media. We will learn how to balance the traditional with the new without overwhelming the written text with gadgets. The class will become a creative lab studying ideas by others, coming up with their own, presenting their fiction, responding to the writing of others, and discussing questions about literature, editing, and publishing in the digital age.  Each student will create and present to class a work of fiction based on some of the ideas we will be discussing.  The works don\u2019t have to be in the electronic form, but the students will need to explain how they would work. Each student will create a basic website with a writer\u2019s profile and portfolio of her works. Readings will include fiction by: Borges, Nabokov, Michael Joyce, Margaret Atwood, Jennifer Egan.\n\r      ", "classification": "ELEC-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor (Vapnyar@hotmail.com).", "instructors": ["Vapnyar, Larisa"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2546", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "BOBS 937", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

As part of the \"hidden\" organizing work of groups excluded and marginalized from dominant normalizing political cultures, collectors and their collections are a foundational yet largely unrecognized group of cultural activists.  This course will examine our own subject positions and our gleanings, visit collectors and their collections, and examine critical writings related to collecting, making presence, and the political culture of knowledge-making.  Agnes Varda\u2019s  documentaries The Gleaners and I and Two Years Later will serve as a starting point for the class.

{"course_name": "Thinking with Tragedy: Ancient Genres and their Influences", "description": "This course will explore the nature and influence of the Greek tragic theater in generating theatrical forms that enabled writers in later periods to dramatize tragedy\u2019s central philosophical and theoretical questions, and to theorize drama itself.  Athenian State Theater developed a dramatic form -- tragedy -- that paid its dues both to epic and to ritual, and formalized a space for exploring the complex relations of kinship, eros, gender, the polis, thought and desire.  This course grounds itself in ancient Greek tragedy and pursues its afterlives and aftershocks in the early modern and modern periods, in drama, philosophy, and film.  Tragedy was never without its others\u2014its accompanying satyr play, comedy, philosophy: Euripides in particular is among the most influential explorers and exploders of the genre, and the course will take a special look at his role in shaping early modern ideas of tragedy and tragicomedy.  Throughout we will attend to historical situation, rhetorical resources, genre as category, and questions of the mediation of the tragic in later periods. As a space for our own speculations about the intersections of theory and drama, the course will include readings from Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, Shakespeare, Racine and Beckett, and will give some attention to modern film interpretations of works by these playwrights, including Pasolini\u2019s Medea, Kozintsev\u2019s King Lear, and Kurosawa\u2019s Ran; theoretical readings will include Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Vernant, and Butler. The idea of \u201cThinking with Tragedy\u201d is to build in a space for uncovering the exfoliations of tragedy into other genres and forms, and for speculation on the generative power of tragedy for aesthetic theory.\n\r      ", "classification": "ELEC-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "Same as COLIT-GA 2821 and POET-GA 2001.

{"course_name": "Fiction Inside out", "description": "In this craft-oriented class, we will identify and practice the essential technical elements of fiction writing. We will look under the hood, take the back off the clock, peer into the innards, in order to study the formal decisions necessary for effective story-telling. Our inquiry will include point of entry; character and plot; creating meaningful scenes; interiority v/s external action; exposition; the management of time; the position of the narrator; linear v/s modular  design; dialogue and its uses; conflict and resolution; image systems and so on.  Fun exercises that encourage play, class readings, technique essays and student work  will be points of departure for our enquiries into the internal workings of fiction. Readings may include Bausch, Gordon, Coetzee, Marcus, Mueenuddin  Jin, Ngochi Adiche and craft essays by Baxter, Gass, Scoffield and Hrijbal among others.\n\r      ", "classification": "ELEC-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor (meerav3@gmail.com).", "instructors": ["Nair, Meera"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2544", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "BOBS 937", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Community: Approaches to the Concept", "description": "Students in this seminar investigate \u2018community\u2019 from a variety of theoretical and disciplinary approaches: sociology, psychology, anthropology, history, philosophy. They explore different ways community can be conceived and formed: as locality, as interest group, as action, as discourse. On one level, the course is designed for students specifically engaged in either or both analyzing and building community; on another level, it uses \u2018community\u2019 as just one example of a complex concept in the social domain, and samples the variety of ways different kinds of scholars have tried to study and theorize it. In the latter sense, the course is appropriate even for students focused on problems other than community, because it introduces them to the practice of interdisciplinary inquiry in the broad realm of social phenomena. It encourages them to grapple with the methodological differences among such broad paradigms as positivism, interpretivism, and poststructuralism, and to try out ideas and methods from each. Readings may include works by such authors as Elijah Anderson, Vered Amit, Anthony Cohen, Gerard Delanty, John Jackson, and Miranda Joseph.\n\r      ", "classification": "ELEC-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Open to advanced undergraduates with permission of the instructor (david.moore@nyu.edu).", "instructors": ["Moore, David"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2718", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "BOBS LL140", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
