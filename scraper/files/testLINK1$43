During this period, London at the height of its Renaissance power, was a center of dramatic arts unparalleled in the rest of Europe. Volumes of plays were written, theaters were built all over London, and each day, during the season, those theaters were filled with audiences who were drawn from every social and economic class and both genders. Theater was a craze. It was the center of cultural life in London. And in the center of this remarkably, vibrant creative world, Shakespeare was a superstar. We examine the city of London, Shakespeare, and theater from literary, historical, political and cultural perspectives. Our consideration of the theater is in relation to other forms of popular entertainment, such as singing, dancing and mountebank performances, and how they might have influenced Shakespeare. We read a selection of plays written by Shakespeare, that might include As You Like It, Much Ado About Nothing, Richard III, Hamlet, and Measure for Measure.

{"course_name": "Self-Consciousness & Other Burdens of Modernity: European Writing Rousseau to Ibsen", "description": "Today it is widely believed that each of us is a one, unique.

Rousseau\u2019s self-assertion was radical in its time but he spoke for an era that would come to depict growing up as the discovery of personal knowledge and associate maturity with the attainment of individuality and self-sufficiency. Central to that cultural historical trend was the emergence of the modern novel as a major literary form.

In Buddhism, evil appears because of ignorance or illusion, which mistakes our \u2018self\u2019 and the world to be made up of independent and permanent \u201cthings.\u201d In the Christian West, evil was seen as a necessary by-product of a \"free will\" whose corruption or depravity must be acknowledged to achieve any human goodness. Framed philosophically, as a value judgment that has historically been assigned to intentionally harmful actions, misfortune, or even natural disasters such as the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, evil came to be problematized in the West in the question: \u201cHow could a benevolent God allow the innocent to suffer?\u201d We will survey the depth of that question, but also ask: Is this formulation of \u201cthe problem of evil\u201d uniquely Western in its assumption that a god must be absolutely good? In addition, we will approach the concept of evil psychologically, by examining demonic possession and exorcism, as well as recurring complicity in mass atrocities, which will lead us to consider the theory of \"the scapegoat,\" and the very different idea that evil now is \"banal,\" as unthinking people become part of the machinery of modern power.

While some argue that art is autonomous from ethics, others insist that ethics is a necessary component of art and of one\u2019s aesthetic judgment of the work. This course explores the various positions that have been taken in this debate and raises several key questions: Can art be morally enlightening and, if so, how? If a work of art is morally better, does that make it better as art? Is morally deficient art to be shunned, or even censored? Do subjects of artworks have rights as to how they are represented? Do artists have duties as artists and duties as human beings, and if so, to whom? How much tension is there between the demands of art and the demands of life? These questions will be examined through the lens of painting (Rembrandt, Picasso), cinema (Pasolini, Reed, Griffith), photography (Mann, Mapplethorpe) and literature (Nabokov) with readings drawn from Hume, Plato, Tolstoy, Wilde, Nussbaum, Danto, as well as other contemporary philosophers, artists, and critics.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.00 AM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Trogan, Christopher"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1795", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "SILV 406", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

This dream deeply informs our psychic and political lives. In most cases American popular culture reproduces and even magnifies this myth rather than subject it to criticism.  Economic downturns, lost wars and social stagnation are rarely acknowledged in popular American cinema, and failure is a surprisingly rare subject.  Yet the Coen Brothers\u2014two of the most critically acclaimed contemporary American filmmakers- have made failure their primary subject. From the recent Inside Llewellen Davis to their first film, Blood Simple, their work abounds with losers, lost hopes, and broken dreams. Their films also challenge and rework established film genres\u2014the western, crime caper, film noir, musical, and even art house film\u2014as they disturb the ideology that drives these narrative forms. In this class we will examine how  the genres of American film are structured by the American Dream, and how the Coens (as well as other filmmakers) criticize its promise of prosperity, upward mobility, recognition, and fulfillment.

{"course_name": "Guilty Subjects: Guilt in Literature, Law and Psychoanalysis", "description": "This seminar will explore guilt as the link between the three broad disciplinary arenas of our title. Literary works from ancient tragedy to the modern novel thematize guilt in various ways. Freud places it at the center of his practice and his theory of mind. While law seems reliant mainly upon a formal attribution of guilt in order to determine who gets punished and to what degree, we might also suggest it relies upon ?guilty subjects? for its operation. With all of these different deployments of the concept, we might agree it is a central one, yet how to define it remains a substantial question. Is the prominence of guilt in modern Western culture a vestige of a now-lost religious world? Is it, as Nietzsche suggests, an effect of ?the most profound change man ever experienced when he finally found himself enclosed within the wall of society and of peace?? Freud seems to concur when he argues that guilt must be understood as a kind of internal self-division where aggressivity is turned against the self. Is guilt a pointless self-punishment, meant to discipline us? Or does it continue to have an important relation to the ethical?

{"course_name": "Good Design:  Scale", "description": "Good Design takes as its premise that visual literacy is a vital yet under-examined area of academic discourse. Although we engage the designed environment every day, non-specialists have few ways to make sense of the myriad decisions that are used in creating objects, habitations, and landscapes. Through a combination of reading, drawing, writing, and model-making, this course asks students to examine the complex intersections between analyzing existing designs and creating new work. One central question is whether design principles that operate at a small scale, say the scale of a hand-held object, are also appropriate at a larger scale, say the scale of human habitation. The course uses scale as a lens through which to view the designed environment, as readings and projects consider the design of something you can hold (such as a tool), the design of something that can hold the body (such as clothing or furniture), and something that can be inhabited (such as a dwelling). Discussions of the readings, analytic writing, and student-designed work will structure the majority of course meetings. Readings may include: Edgar Kaufmann, Jr. and the original Museum of Modern Art curatorial Good Design texts from the 1950s; Paola Antonelli, Humble Masterpieces: Everyday Marvels of Design; Pietra Rivoli, The Travels of a T-shirt in the Global Economy; Jay Greene, Design is How It Works; Richard Dyer, White; Joseph Rykwert, On Adam's House in Paradise and others.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '10.45 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '10.45 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Harpman, Louise", "Harpman, Louise"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1750", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "SILV 621", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Besides evoking specific temporalities and narrative tone, fashion plays an important role in the construction of gender, both in terms of representation and address. This course will examine the history of the intersection of the fashion and media industries from the free distribution of film-related dress patterns in movie theaters of the 1910s to the current trend for make-over TV, networks like the Style network, the increasing proliferation of fashion blogs and the construction of specifically feminine video games.

{"course_name": "Globalization: Promises and Discontents", "description": "In popular and scholarly discourse, the term ?globalization? is widely used to put a name to the shape of the contemporary world. In the realms of advertising, policymaking, politics, academia, and everyday talk, ?globalization? references the sense that we are now living in a deeply and ever-increasingly interconnected, mobile, and speeded-up world that is unprecedented, fueled by technological innovations and geopolitical and economic transformations. Often, globalization is presumed to be not only an intrinsically new economic, cultural and technological force, but also one originating in the West and ushering cultural homogenization throughout the world. Drawing on perspectives from history, anthropology, cultural and literary studies, geography, political economy, and sociology, this course will critically examine such presumptions and explore theories, discourses, and experiences of globalization. Running through the course are three central concerns: 1) exploring claims about the novelty of globalization from historical perspectives, 2) examining the variety of ways in which social and cultural worlds mediate globalization and the multiple routes it can take, and 3) analyzing a contested politics of globalization in which the opportunities for social mobility and transformation are pitted against renewed intensifications of exploitation and vulnerability along long-standing vectors of difference and inequality.

We will begin by tracing the invention of the medium from the mid-1950s, and the subsequent effect on both artists and non-artists as video technology became more commonplace and affordable in the 1970s. We will consider the history of video art, from William Wegman, Vito Acconci, Gary Hill, and Linda Benglis, to Bill Viola, Eija-Liisa Ahtila, and Walid Raad, among many others.

{"course_name": "The Sublime", "description": "Art of the sublime stirs up strong emotions and competing evaluations. Often labeled \u201cindescribable,\u201d the sublime has been debated for centuries amongst writers, poets, artists, and philosophers. The concept goes back to classical Greece, but it became particularly important in eighteenth century Europe. At that time the sublime was applied in relation to the creative arts to describe aspects of nature that instill awe and wonder such as mountains, avalanches, waterfalls, stormy seas, or the infinite vault of the starry sky. In the wake of the French Revolution, the sublime for the Romantics became a quasi-secular route to cultural and aesthetic freedom through contact with the unbounded and the supersensible. In our contemporary world, where culture and gender difference, psychoanalysis, postmodern theory, technology, neuroscience, and neoliberal spectacle seem to eclipse former concepts of nature and transcendent experience, the characteristics of the sublime are perhaps more fuzzy than ever. The term and the debates however remain very much alive and relevant to contemporary aesthetic, metaphysical, and ethical concerns.

A daughter's sacrifice is required: or is it? Patriotism motivates war: or does it? Euripides' Iphigenia in Aulis is a brilliant, vertiginous investigation into the intersection of war, sacrifice, politics, and kinship. Through Euripides, we see how a marriage might become a sacrifice; how motives shift over time; how conflicts in one moment are reframed in another \u2014this play is a stunning inquiry into the tricky ways of reason and passion. We will begin with Iphigenia in Aulis and the tradition it mobilizes\u2014that Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks, is compelled to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia in order to ensure a fair wind for the sailing of the Greek expedition against Troy. Behind this play are centuries of profound, complex thinking about reasons for war, the nature of heroism, the rhetorics of patriotism, the obligations of kinship, the logic of marriage. From the Iliad through the efllorescence of tragedy in Athenian state theater, to early modern and 21st century adaptations and transformations, poets and playwrights have found Iphigenia \"good to think with.\" Our classes will combine critical inquiry into Euripides' Iphigenia in Aulis and other ancient and modern treatments of the Iphigenia myth, together with experiments in interpretation\u2014including acting workshops and staging exercises. Students need no background in acting, theater, or ancient literature, but do need critical energy and discipline.

Many of the unemployed took to the road in search of work, preferring to give up their homes rather than their cars; others hitchhiked and rode the rails. Ironically, it was also a time for leisure travel too, and this was the era when taking a family trip on a paid vacation became a national ritual. Government and industry promoted tourism to help the economy\u2014and to pacify the working class. But getting people to travel required a deliberate, large-scale effort. As one tourism promoter put it, \u201cThe travel habit was not born with Americans. It\u2019s an acquired taste that must be religiously and patiently cultivated.\u201d So the Roosevelt administration created a national travel bureau to assist the hospitality industry, poured millions of dollars into roads and highways, and put authors like Eudora Welty, Saul Bellow, and Ralph Ellison to work writing WPA travel guides. The travel theme attracted novelists like Nathaniel West and Nelson Algren, who used the journey motif in their fictions, and writer-and-photographer teams like James Agee and Walker Evans traveled to document the suffering of sharecroppers and migrant workers.

How essential are the concepts of \u201clikeness\u201d and \u201crealism\u201d to the definition of a portrait, and to its function? How are ancient portraits manipulated to serve specific public or private roles? Who does the manipulating, and who is the audience?

{"course_name": "Domesticating The Wild in Children's Literature", "description": "The Ur-text of literatures for children is the encounter between a child and a Wild Thing. From Little Red Ridinghood to Peter and the Wolf to Charlotte?s Web, the border between the child and the wild is a rite of passage marking the transformation of the child into an adult and is the site of a child?s most fundamental education about how to be human. Works of children?s literature agree that literature can be used to explicitly structure the relationship between children and the wild, and to construct subjectivities by nurturing a deeper awareness of what that relationship should be. Yet, what, exactly, is the wild in children?s literature? Representations of the wild reflect adult ideas about children?do they have a privileged relationship to nature and innate understanding of the connection between humans and the world around them? Or are they wild things themselves, in need of templates for human/humane behavior toward other beings? Representations of the wild are also informed by ideology, shaped by societal ideas about race and gender, domination and subjection, power and privilege. In this course we will be thinking and writing about the surprising ways in which children?s texts imagine the wild as a charged cultural, political and racialized space, and how these texts imagine and construct subjectivities based on these relations of power. Text may include Babar, The Wind in the Willows, Alice in Wonderland, Where the Wild Things Are, Ricky Tiki Tavi and Fantasia.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '6.10 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Priest, Myisha"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1596", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "SILV 501", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Politics, Writing and the Nobel Prize in Latin Amarica", "description": "In the course of the twentieth century, seven Latin American authors have won the Nobel Prize: Gabriela Mistral (1945); Miguel Angel Asturias (1967); Pablo Neruda (1971); Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982); Octavio Paz (1990); Rigoberto Mench\u00fa (Peace Prize, 1992); Mario Vargas Llosa (2010). Together, they give us a chance to consider some of the major literary and political movements in Latin America leading up to the present. Through novels and autobiography, Asturias and Mench\u00fa explore very different aspects of the indigenous struggle in Guatamala; the poetry of Mistral and Neruda reveals the successive influences of surrealism, communism, socialism, up to the eve of the Pinochet coup in Chile; the novels of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in Colombia and Vargas Llosa in Peru embody different sides of magical realism; and Paz, in Mexico, in his poetry and essays, represents a country that has been a literary cornerstone of Latin America.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "INSTRUCTOR: LINN MEHTA", "instructors": ["Mehta, Linn", "Mehta, Linn"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1711", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "SILV 621", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "The Qur'An", "description": "The political upheavals and events of recent years have focused much attention on \u201cIslam\u201d and its cultures and texts, especially the Qur\u2019an. Most of the attention and interest in the Qur\u2019an, however, has been reductive and superficial, amounting to no more than de-contextualized misreadings of certain verses in most cases. This seminar will serve as an introduction to the Qur\u2019an as scripture, but also as a generative and polyphonic cultural text. We will start with a brief look at the legacy of Qur\u2019anic studies within the larger paradigm of Orientalist scholarship and \u201cWestern\u201d approaches to all things Islamic. We will, then, address the historical and cultural background and context of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s genesis as an oral revelation, its intimate affinities with Biblical and Near Eastern narratives, and its transformation into a written and canonized text after the death of Muhammad. We will then examine the Qur\u2019an\u2019s structure as a \u201cbook\u201d and read selections from its most famous chapters and explore how they were deployed in various discourses as Islam became the official religion of a civilization and an empire. Readings and discussions will focus on the themes of prophecy, gender and sexuality, violence and peace. The seminar neither assumes nor requires any prior knowledge of Islamic studies or Arabic.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Antoon, Sinan"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1357", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "194M 201", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Trash Matters: Exploring Development, Environment, and Culture through Garbage", "description": "This course considers the production, management, and disposal of garbage as a dynamic cultural phenomenon that can lend insight into a broad array of questions at the nexus of environment and development. Most broadly, unpacking waste\u2019s deep political and cultural dimensions provides for critical reflection on urbanism, social relations of difference, global economic processes, and people\u2019s relationships to nature. After exploring theories of waste and value, the course examines a broad selection of historic and contemporary geographies of waste from New York to Bangladesh for insight into specific debates and phenomena inscribed within these larger themes. Specific themes will include: the role of discourses and practices of waste in patterns of racial injustice and segregation in the colonial period to the contemporary era; concepts of pollution governing debates on sustainability and the urban environment; formal and informal labors of garbage management and questions of stigma and rights to the city; global waste circulations and capitalist globalization; the transformation of value and meaning involved in diverse processes of recycling; waste-based social movements and rebellion through disorder; the art of rubbish.

{"course_name": "Contemporary Visual Culture and the Politics of Images", "description": "In this course students learn to think about the reading and writing practices of contemporary visual culture. What does it mean to \u201cread\u201d an image? How are images used politically? Is what is \u201cun-seen\u201d as important as what is seen? Students tackle philosophical, ethical, and political questions, and are encouraged to pursue topics that interest them for assigned papers and projects. We will ground our discussions in relevant theory and will explore all manner of visual genres, including the graphic novel form, film, magazine ads, and photography. In examining the politics of visual images, this course places special, extended emphasis on images in the context of war. Moreover, we will think about our own roles in contemporary visual culture; we are consumers, participators, creators, and sometimes we have no power over images. What does this mean for us when considered through, for example, an ethical or aesthetic or humanitarian lens? Critical literature by Susan Sontag, Susie Linfield, Scott McCloud, and Marita Sturken, among others, will inform our discussions and deepen student writing. Our syllabus also includes journalistic accounts and war photography, including work by Joe Sacco and James Nachtwey, as well as at least one piece by the writer and documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Students will write reaction papers, longer essays, and have the option of a visual project.\n\r      ", "classification": "IDSEM-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.00 AM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Walsh, Lauren"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1775", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 501", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
