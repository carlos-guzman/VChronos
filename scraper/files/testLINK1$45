{"course_name": "Seminar:", "description": "This seminar explores how the trope of ?blackness? is medThis seminar explores how the trope of ?blackness? is mediated over a range of ideas, images, and expressions of social difference in cinema. Screenings and readings examine how popular cinema, ranging from black independence to the commercial ?mainstream,? deals not only with issues of race and color, but how these issues intersect, and interact, with other social categories of difference(s) mainly related to class, sexual orientation, and gender but including many others. The course explores such issues as seeing beyond the ?black-white binary? model of race relations; gendered perspectives on ?blackness? and black women?s filmmaking; the cultural and political dynamic between blackness and gayness on the screen; and issues of class, caste, and ?colorism? in cinema. The course also examines a number of ideas and theories related to the material, including passing, double consciousness, unmarked difference, and creolization.\n\r      ", "classification": "AFRS-GA", "grading": "GSAS Graded", "class_name": "The Black Body and the Lens", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, print, video, film and exhibition spaces. Central to our discussions will be a focus on how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary, between self-presentation and imposed representation--all are fundamental to our discussions. This seminar will also explore the ways in which our contemporary understanding of art, history, and culture is constructed and informed by public display in museums, text, and the global landscape. Our specific focus will be on African, African American and African diaspora visual culture. We will consider issues of representation, display and reception as well as the wider social context in which art and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field trips will be taken to museums and galleries. In this course, we shall analyze the diverse ways in which scholars and artists have written about sexuality, black womanhood, and manhood. We will read a variety of significant texts including key examples of cutting-edge scholarship and other writings.", "instructors": ["Willis, Deborah"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2303", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "20CS 4SEM", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
