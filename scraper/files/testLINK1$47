{"course_name": "Intro to Immunology", "description": "This comprehensive core course, designed for research-oriented students, provides a broad but intensive examination of the immune response, with a special emphasis on the experimental approaches that led to our current understanding of immunological principles. Students are assigned weekly reading in the form of textbook chapters and a primary research paper. Students and faculty discuss the textbook information during one session each week, and regular quizzes on this information provide feedback to all students on their preparation and progress. Critical analysis of the original research articles in a discussion format is held on Fridays. The research papers form the starting point for a dialogue between students and faculty that probes intellectual and practical questions in immunology research, venturing beyond the material presented in the papers into related issues and current research.\n\r      ", "classification": "BMSC-GA", "grading": "GSAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.00 PM', 'end': '1.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2306", "loc_code": "MC", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Molecular Pharmacology of Receptors", "description": "This course gives an overview of the principles in pharmacology, modern approaches to studying pharmacology, and molecular aspects of receptors and signal transduction. The course is divided into three parts. The first part, introduction to molecular pharmacology, focuses on some of the basic concepts in signaling, drug-receptor interactions, and pharmacokinetics. The second part, modern approaches to pharmacological research, emphasizes methods such as crystallography, mass spectrometry, and genetic studies with Drosophila and C. elegans as pharmacological tools. The third part, applications of pharmacology research, focuses on the structure and function of tyrosine kinase receptors, receptor phosphatases, G protein receptors, insulin receptors, steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor gene family, glycoproteins and proteoglycans of the nervous system, recycling and internalization of receptors, exocytosis and receptors for neurotransmitters, and proteolytic processing of receptors and ligands. Classes include lectures as well as weekly discussions on selected papers.\n\r      ", "classification": "BMSC-GA", "grading": "GSAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.30 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2406", "loc_code": "MC", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
