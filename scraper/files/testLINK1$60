In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century.  Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions.

By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency.  Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English.  It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.", "instructors": ["Waters, John"], "component": "Colloquium", "number": "1083", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "ERIN 101", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.", "instructors": ["Lee, John"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1421", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "ERIN 101", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
