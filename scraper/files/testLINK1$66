Popular and academic representations, however, tend to render the region as insular, homogenous, and historically static. Rather than isolate the Arabian Peninsula from these broader connections, this course examines the complex global linkages \u2013 through financial flows, regulatory bodies, political institutions, labor markets, kinship networks, and religious circuits \u2013 that structure the region.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the historically dominant approaches to studying the political economy of the Arabian Peninsula. It will then take up a more recent multidisciplinary and comparative literature \u2013 drawn from history, geography, political economy and other fields \u2013 that builds on and challenges these earlier analyses. This literature will serve as the basis for a number of thematic case studies that aim to reshape the conceptual tools used to examine the region. Topics include: \u201cRent\u201d and the Rentier State, Capitalism and Class Formation, Labor: Discipline and Resistance, Water Politics, and Neoliberalism and the City.", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "3003", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Particular attention will be given to the classical notions of the state, citizenship, civility, civil society, state of exception, power and domination. The purpose of the class, beyond reading some classics in sociology, is to help students connect empirical evidence from the region with ongoing conceptual or theoretical elaborations.", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2785", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

The course will be composed of lectures and class discussions. It will survey past instances of revolutions in the Middle East, leading to a cross-analysis of the wave of revolts that affected most of the Arab countries in 2011. Part of the course will compare bottom-up calls for political changes, in particular civil society\u2019s variegated attempts (youth, media, trade unions, radical groups) at playing a more active role in the region. Another section of the course will analyze the western community\u2019s response to the revolts, illustrating how the USA and Europe have, by and large, failed the revolts. A last section of the course will shed light on the nascent historiography of the revolts, contrasting how early positive interpretations have turned into much more sobering accounts of how conservative forces might be keeping or regaining the upper hands in many Arab countries.", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2999", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Our aim is to learn and think critically about ways to study the anthropology of the stat, focusing on the interrelated approaches of political economy, law and citizenship, and nationalism. We begin with a series of texts that have been influential in the Middle East Studies, anthropology, and political theory. The second half of this seminar is dedicated to discussing recent political anthropology on Lebanon, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Turkey, and Arab Gulf states. Throughout we will be thinking critically about the the political economy of interest on the Middle East and how this political economy of interest has shaped anthropological inquiry into the region and its peoples. We will examine the ways in which anthropological literature has both challenged and confirmed many of the dominant paradigms through which the modern state in the Middle East is studied.", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "3002", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

In many ways, the course is one in historiography, and class discussions, assignments, and assessments will be geared toward enhancing critical analysis of various historians\u2019 methods of recording the region\u2019s history. We pose basic but important questions: how has the history of the modern Middle East been written in different academic circles? Which historiographic approaches have historians employed to make sense of the myriad of economic, political, and social developments that have swept the region since the 19th century? Which of these have been effective and which need to be reassessed? Which historical themes have dominated literature on the history of the region? Are we in need of different ones? Where is the field going and where do we fit in its evolution?\n\nTo get at these and many more questions, we will examine a range of historical works on various themes related to the modern Middle East. These include, among others, nationalism, modernity, colonialism, gender, class, labor, health, and the environment. While the course is designed to address a wide range of themes and events from the region, students are encouraged to consult the instructor for further readings on historical narratives not covered in the main reading list. The final paper, which will be topical and determined by each student and the instructor, will also allow students to explore a field and area of their interest. By the end of the semester, students should feel comfortable developing new ways of thinking and writing critically about Middle Eastern historical trajectories.", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2005", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
