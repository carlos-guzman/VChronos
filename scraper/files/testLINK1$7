This predicament, which faces all historians, is unavoidable in the study of Korean history as well, particularly because the postcolonial division of the two Koreas has conditioned the use and abuse of national history in dealing with contemporary social concerns.

We will also trace how people in Korea, individually and collectively, have been affected by, and have responded to, these historical changes in their everyday lives and beyond.
