{"course_name": "Principles of Securities Trading", "description": "Most finance courses focus on how securities are defined, valued and used. This course is about how securities are traded: the design, operation and regulation of trading processes, mechanisms and protocols. Today's markets for stocks, bonds, and derivatives span a wide range in sophistication and complexity. For some securities, the market has evolved to an integrated network that offers very high levels of access and transparency. At the other extreme we have markets that operate as small dealer networks sustained by reputation and relationship. Some mechanisms are new (the open electronic limit order book)\u037e some are as old as antiquity (the single price call auction). We have a general sense that all markets are heading toward some sort of electronic future, but the speed of progress and convergence varies widely. Our\nmarkets are infused with tensions between efficiency and fairness, competition and regulation, consolidation and fragmentation, speed and stability, and so on.\nThe course is based on a realistic picture of the trading process, so we go into a fair amount of institutional detail, as well as some law and market regulation. The intellectual framework for the material comes from mainstream economics, financial economics, and the newer subfield of financial economics known as market microstructure.\n\r      ", "classification": "FINC-UB", "grading": "Ugrd Stern Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '10.45 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '10.45 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Hasbrouck, Joel", "Hasbrouck, Joel"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "49", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Leonard N.

{"course_name": "Hedge Fund Strategies", "description": "This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the strategies used by hedge funds, employing a hands-on approach based on case studies and real data. The hedge fund industry has grown rapidly over the last decade aided in part by the private nature of funds and light regulation that has enabled managers to employ strategies not available to traditional fund managers. The course examines critical aspects of hedge fund investment styles including the trading mechanism, risk-return profiles of investment styles, trading costs, risk management and performance measurement..Strategies covered include event driven strategies, equity, debt, FX, cross-market strategies, global macro and shareholder activism. Distinguished guest speakers will be invited to provide a real-life perspective and to discuss key issues.\n\r      ", "classification": "FINC-UB", "grading": "Ugrd Stern Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '11.00 AM', 'end': '12.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '11.00 AM', 'end': '12.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Jog, Manjiree", "Jog, Manjiree"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "66", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Leonard N.

{"course_name": "Advanced Corp Finance", "description": "The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the core concepts and theory underlying much of the general understanding of corporate finance and its impact on corporate valuation. The first part of the course consists of lectures on corporate finance theory which explore the links between a firm's financing decisions, its investment decisions, and corporate structure through the lenses of taxes, information asymmetries, and the conflicts of interest between its various stakeholders. The second part of the course consists of case studies which illustrate the relevance of the theoretical framework for (understanding and designing) real-world corporate financial strategy and for (understanding and dealing with) strategic issues in corporate valuation. The course material is organized around central corporate finance \"concepts\" (debt overhang, risk-shifting, managerial agency, adverse selection, etc.) and \"applications\" (bankruptcy and restructuring, IPOs and valuation, M&A;, corporate governance, etc.).\n\r      ", "classification": "FINC-UB", "grading": "Ugrd Stern Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "PREREQUISITE: FIN-UB 7 OR FINC-UB 9007 OR IBEX-UB 2001", "instructors": ["Halov, Nikolay", "Halov, Nikolay"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "8", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Leonard N.
