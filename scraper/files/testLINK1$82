{"course_name": "Experiential Learning Seminar:  Fashion Industry: Creativity & Business", "description": "There are many challenges in running a fashion business. Marrying the oftentimes conflicting views and orientations of the creative side of the business with the practical operational realities of making money is one of the largest ones. This course is a Junior/Senior Undergraduate Experiential Learning Workshop. It provides students with the opportunity to work on projects with executives, designers, merchandisers, manufacturers and marketers from leading fashion companies and start-up ventures. Both established players and entrepreneurial ventures will be represented, focusing on specific challenges the fashion industry faces in finance, marketing, sales, manufacturing, management and operations. This is a project based class. Students will learn the ins and outs of the fashion industry through working on \u201clive cases.\u201d It is an opportunity to marry the theory and process learned in the core classes, with the reality of running real businesses in a creative and dynamic industry. The basic format of the class is learn by doing. This will be a highly interactive class with an emphasis on participation and application. Projects will cover all aspects of the industry and will vary from working with established fashion brands and retailers to helping start-ups launch their businesses. Each project will have a student team (maximum five members, a project leader from the host company and an academic adviser (Professor Carr or Professor Ferrara). Many of the projects will come from the Council of Fashion Designers of Americas (CFDA) members and CFDA Incubator companies. At the completion of the projects, teams will present their analysis and plans to a panel of industry experts who will evaluate them based on their thoroughness and value to the companies.\n\r      ", "classification": "MULT-UB", "grading": "Ugrd Stern Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Carr, Jeffrey", "Carr, Jeffrey"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "104", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Leonard N.
