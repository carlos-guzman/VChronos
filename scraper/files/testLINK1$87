{"course_name": "Creative Writing: Places", "description": "Place not only sets mood in literature, it also functions as\ncharacter. It changes, exerts influence, and is even driven by its own\nmysterious motives. Students in this course will consider how writers\nuse place, geography, landscape, and nationality in literature; they\nwill also practice the depiction and use of these elements in their\nown creative work. The course will emphasize fiction, but will offer\nopportunities to write and analyze creative nonfiction and multimedia\nworks. We\u2019ll look at published literature alongside the stories and\ncreative nonfiction students produce. The course will require\nextensive writing, class participation, and peer feedback: most\nsessions will be devoted to workshops of student writing. The goal? To\nbecome better readers and creative writers, and to develop a\nheightened appreciation for the role of place in literature, as well\nas the complexity of producing literary work.\n\r      ", "classification": "CWP-UF", "grading": "Ugrd FAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Open to Liberal Studies & Global Liberal Studies only.", "instructors": ["Eve, Sean", "Eve, Sean"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "101", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Liberal Studies", "location": "GCASL 265", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
