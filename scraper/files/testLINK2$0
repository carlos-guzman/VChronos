We will focus on legisl ation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare.

{"course_name": "Ethics and Animal", "description": "This course examines the morality of our treatment of nonhuman animals. We start by asking about the nature of moral rights and duties. What are rights, and where do they come from? How do we resolve conflicts among rights? Do animals have rights? Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We then ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or companionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy? Here we consider abolition vs. regulation, incrementalism vs. absolutism, and legal reform vs. direct action.\n\r      ", "classification": "ANST-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '7.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "Open to Animal Studies minors during the first week of registration. Courses will open to all students thereafter. Animal Studies minors should contact the AS Adviser for access.\n\nThis course will examine the morality of our treatment of nonhuman animals. We will start with a survey of moral theory. Do animals have moral status? Do we have a right to harm or kill some animals in order to bene\ft or save others? We will consider these questions from a variety of moral perspectives, including utilitarianism, rights theory, contractualism, feminism, and contextualism. We will then apply these ideas to di\u000berent kinds of animal use. For example, what is the morality of our treatment of animals in food, research, entertainment, captivity, and the wild? Finally, we will explore the connections between human rights and animal rights; the legal, economic, and psychological barriers in the way of reform; and the ethics of activism and advocacy.", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "400", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "194M 307", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Making Art in the Anthropocene: Project on Ecology, Species and Vibrant Matter", "description": "\u201cEither stop writing, or write like a rat!\u201d In one of the most provocative texts in contemporary animal philosophy, the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari famously propose \u201cbecoming animal\u201d as a liberating artistic practice. This workshop-cum-seminar will engage with key themes in recent \u201cpost-humanist\u201d discourse by applying and testing them in our own creative practice. We will read recent theories of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors, Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear, Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo). Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space, objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic implications of these theoretical ideas. A main interest of this course is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making as well as by thinking/writing/speaking. Prior artistic training/practice is welcomed but not required; however, all students must be willing to and interested in exploring their \"inner artist.\"\n\r      ", "classification": "ANST-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "Note: Section open to AS minors only.
