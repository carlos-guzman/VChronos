The creation of Affordable Housing, Sustainable  Communities and Livable Cities has been the topic of numerous books, worldwide conferences, and serious research and study by architects, urban designers, planners, environmental psychologists, sociologists, real estate professionals, economists and legal professionals in universities, governmental institutes, professional organizations and the United Nations.

Caravaggio's radical realism, Bernini's exalted rhetoric, and Poussin's coolly intellectual classicism might not seem, at first glance, to have much in common. But if we look beyond differences of style to the underlying preoccupations that informed their work, we discover that all three artists were deeply interested in the poetics of vision. In representations of the encounter between the human and the divine, they imagined away the boundaries between the visible and the invisible, matter and spirit, man and god: dualities at the heart of the human condition.

Organized chronologically and thematically and drawing on scholarship in art history, anthropology, history, literature, and other disciplines, this seminar examines the monstrous and the grotesque in the western visual tradition from antiquity to the contemporary world.  Introductory meetings are devoted to establishing the physical and visual forms and psychological, cultural, social, and political functions of monsters in western art and culture.  Topics to be examined may include the Greco-Roman tradition of the \u201cmonstrous races\u201d in their ancient and medieval contexts; physical deformity and metamorphosis in art and thought; marvelous beasts; hybrids and hybridity in ancient and medieval art; devils and demons; and encounters with monsters and marvels in travel literature such as Marco Polo\u2019s Travels and The Book of John Mandeville.  Early class sessions also consider the monstrous and the grotesque in the work of a selection of Renaissance, Baroque, and modern and contemporary figures, monuments, and movements, possibly including Leonardo, Piero di Cosimo, Bosch, Gr\u00fcnewald, Archimboldo, Francisco de Goya, the Symbolists, the Surrealists, Francis Bacon, and artists featured in the exhibition, Disparities and Deformations: Our Grotesque (SITE Santa Fe, 2004).  Requirements of the course include (in addition to attendance and participation in discussion) short (ca. 2-3-page) response papers based on the readings assigned in the early weeks of the course, and an oral report and a final paper (ca. 12-15 pages) on a research topic of the student\u2019s choice (an artist, a work or art, or a pictorial theme). \n\nAlthough the course focuses on the western visual tradition -- many of the most recent, productive methodological models for work on monsters and the grotesque are found in scholarship on western art and literature -- students with an interest in other artistic traditions, including East Asian, South Asian, Islamic, Native American, Pre-Columbian, or African art, are welcome to pursue research projects on topics in these fields.", "instructors": ["Smith, Kathryn"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "800", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "SILV 302", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "003"}
