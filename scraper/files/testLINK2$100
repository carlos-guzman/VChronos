The course explores classical and contemporary schools of thought regarding rationales for growth, as well as social and moral consequences of development. Students will consider philosophical and political arguments for and against growth; analyze complex relationships between individual and society, between humankind and nature, and ultimately, between economic growth and cosmic evolution; recognize unintended consequences of growth, and gain an appreciation for our responsibilities at a time when technological progress poses unlimited potential as well as daunting challenges.\n\r      ", "classification": "CORES-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Chu, Ted", "Chu, Ted"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "47", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
