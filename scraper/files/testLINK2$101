{"course_name": "Senior Capstone Design Project", "description": "The senior capstone design project focuses on the synthesis of technology with human needs and values. It provides an opportunity for teams to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, and business concerns with engineering design. While projects offered focus on development of a product or technology, the breadth of issues related to transforming them into every day private or  business life is an integral component of the project. In the fall semester student teams develop a specification for the product being considered, generate multiple solution concepts with particular emphasis on cultural implications of the choices, identify an optimal concept and address any limitations it might have, and then select and develop a plan for addressing the problem and designing a solution. As determined by the specifics of the project, the team may also develop associated strategies for commercialization, including potential sources for follow-on development funding, intellectual\nproperty management, and graphics and text for advertising campaigns, approaches to measuring customer satisfaction, ethical issues, etc. Students\npractice critical skills in communication, teambuilding, management, and motivation. They prepare weekly memos that summarize the team\u2019s activities and address important developments associated with the project. Each student is required to keep a notebook, documenting his or her activities, designs, and considerations. In the middle of each semester, students present their ideas and concepts in a project review. The students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in the spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of experienced engineers.\n\r      ", "classification": "ENGR-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.45 AM', 'day': 'Sun'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "400", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
