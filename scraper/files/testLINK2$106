{"course_name": "Global Debate on Green Growth", "description": "In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. \nIn response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. \nIronically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. \nWe will examine how major industrial powers are approaching  the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.\n\r      ", "classification": "MDENV-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.10 PM', 'end': '3.25 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '2.10 PM', 'end': '3.25 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Kalantzakos, Sophia", "Kalantzakos, Sophia"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "115", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
