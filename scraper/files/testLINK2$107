{"course_name": "Music of the Middle East and North Africa", "description": "The Near East (including North Africa, Turkey, Iran and the Gulf) has experienced enormous upheavals over the past century, in large part because of borders drawn by political rather than cultural considerations. Today's Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.\n\r      ", "classification": "MUSIC-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "111", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
