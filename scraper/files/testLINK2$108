{"course_name": "Ancient Mediterranean Philosophy", "description": "An examination of the origins of Western philosophical thought in ancient Greece and Rome, with a special focus on the views of Plato and Aristotle. Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.\n\r      ", "classification": "PHIL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Mitsis, Phillip", "Mitsis, Phillip"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "220", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Reason and Religion", "description": "An examination of various questions that arise in philosophical discussions of religion, such as: Can philosophical reflection help us to prove the existence of God or clarify such puzzling matters as God's relationship to time? How could a benevolent and omnipotent God permit the existence of evil and misfortune? Is it ever rational to form beliefs about matters which transcend the realm of the empirical? Is the concept of a specifically religious experience a coherent one? If not, can religious beliefs be supported by other means? Alternatively, is the entire project of evaluating religious discourse as a set of claims about transcendent realities misguided? What should we make of the alternative explanations of religion and religious phenomena offered by philosophers from al-Farabi to Marx and Nietzsche?\n\r      ", "classification": "PHIL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '2.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '2.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "116", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

{"course_name": "Philosophy of Science", "description": "Science is often taken to be a distinctly rational form of empirical inquiry. This course examines various questions concerning the nature and practice of science that arise from this widespread attitude. For example, scientific theories are often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny in ways that other theories are not. To what extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to believe that our best scientific theories are even approximately true? What justifies the claim that\ndifferent types of evidence lend varying degrees of support to a particular theory, or that a single piece of evidence supports one theory more than another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with \u201creal\u201d explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren\u2019t\n\u201cgenuinely explanatory.\u201d To what extent is this true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction\nor mathematical derivation? Can false theories provide good explanations? Some familiarity with science would be helpful but is not required.\n\r      ", "classification": "PHIL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.10 PM', 'end': '3.25 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '2.10 PM', 'end': '3.25 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Coffey, Kevin J", "Coffey, Kevin J"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "244", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
