{"course_name": "History of Chinese Cinemas", "description": "This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s.  We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.\n\r      ", "classification": "CCCF-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '8.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Core Curriculum requirement: China Arts.\nThis course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): HUMN; GCS.\n\nStudy away students need permission to enroll in this course: please contact shanghai.advising@nyu.edu.
