{"course_name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Culture", "description": "This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.\n\r      ", "classification": "HUMN-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '1.00 PM', 'end': '4.00 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): HUMN.\n\nStudents having a declared NYU Shanghai Humanities major can register for this course at their appointed registration time.

{"course_name": "The Global Economy in the 20 th Century", "description": "This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.   It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.\n \nJeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism:  Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course.  Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book.  Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.\n \nStudents will write two six page papers and have a final exam.  In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term.  Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively.  Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing.  The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions.  A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.\n\r      ", "classification": "HUMN-SHU", "grading": "Ugrd Shanghai Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '1.45 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '1.45 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "This course satisfies the following Major requirement(s): HUMN\n\nStudents having a declared NYU Shanghai Humanities major can register for this course at their appointed registration time.

{"course_name": "Shanghai Stories", "description": "This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today.
