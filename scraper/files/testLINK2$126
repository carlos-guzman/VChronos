The course covers conventional biosensors based on whole cells, nucleic acids, antibodies and enzymes (e.g. enzymatic glucose monitoring) as well as new and emerging technologies related to designing, fabricating and applying  multi-array biochips and micro-fluidic systems (lab-on-the-chip). The goal is to familiarize students with basic principles of biosensors design and applications. The course also covers practical applications of this technology in health care, medical diagnostics, defense and other areas. | Prerequisite: Adviser\u2019s approval.\n\r      ", "classification": "BTE-GY", "grading": "Grad Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.30 PM', 'end': '5.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Vulfson, Evgeny"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6033", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/19/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "A"}
