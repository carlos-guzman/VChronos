{"course_name": "THE HISTORY OF LIGHT", "description": "What is the nature of light? How does it relate to magnets, electric circuits, TVs, radioactivity and the fundamental forces of nature?  More importantly, what really happens to your burrito when you microwave it? This course answers these and similar questions by following the historical development of three apparently distinct and unrelated phenomena\u2014electricity, magnetism and light. Topics range from descriptions of these phenomena by the Greeks to Maxwell\u2019s 19th-century unification of them into a single phenomenon to Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity to their incorporation into the Standard Model of contemporary physics. The course considers theoretical descriptions of the phenomena and technologies derived from them. | Prerequisites: Completion of first year writing requirements. Co-requisites: None.

{"course_name": "The Ship", "description": "Ships, the largest human-made moving objects, have played a pivotal role in trade and warfare throughout history. This course covers the history, development and technology of ships from ancient times to the present. The course discusses aspects of the atmosphere and seas as they relate to ship design and use. Technological advances in hull design, materials, sails and power also will be discussed. The use of ships in trade, human transportation, warfare, fishing, piracy and global exploration are covered, along with the satellite industries of shipbuilding and port support. The course also looks at the manning of ships, the social and military organization, \u00acthe life of mariners, the development of navigation and its technologies in an historical context, and submarine evolution and technologies. | Prerequisites: Completion of first year writing requirements.
