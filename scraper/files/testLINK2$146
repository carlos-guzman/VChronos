Students search analog media for examples of supposedly new technologies like associative thinking, multimedia and  participatory design, and examine the social and economic structures that allow  for such tools to arise and to determine what exactly is new in new media. Further,  the course considers how to use the concept of antecedent to critique present manifestations of media and how to incorporate ideas from the past into the  present while avoiding homologies. | Prerequisites: Completion of first year writing requirements, and one Level 2 STS  cluster elective.

{"course_name": "MEDICAL ETHICS", "description": "This course is concerned with the many ethical issues that arise in the field of medicine, issues such as: patient autonomy, informed consent, experimentation on live subjects, confidentiality, truth telling, conflict of interest and the treatment of relatives.  We will also study moral issues pertaining to new medical techniques such as online medicine and prenatal genetic screening.  These issues will be approached via an understanding of important historical, legal and philosophical foundations of medical ethics.  We will study ideas from the Hippocratic Oath and Islamic, Jewish and Christian traditions up to the codes of today's ethics review boards. Important legal issues explored involve the right to healthcare, the obligation of parents to seek proper medical care for their children and euthanasia.  Some of the important ethical-philosophical notions studied will be: the law of double effect, the obligation of beneficence and non-malevolence, utilitarianism, and Kantian ethics.  While this course is open to all majors, it's specific aim is to prepare the future medical practitioner to understand and deal with the various moral challenges of the profession.  | Prerequisite(s): Completion of first year writing requirements\n\r      ", "classification": "STS-UY", "grading": "Ugrd Poly Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '8.30 AM', 'end': '10.20 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '8.30 AM', 'end': '10.20 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2214", "loc_code": "BRKLN", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Polytechnic School of Engineering", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "A"}

By first examining the nature of science and rhetoric, the course then looks at texts written by scientists and use rhetorical theory to\nanalyze those texts. Students look at the professional scientific research articles and other genres of scientific writing. Finally, students investigate the way that rhetoric plays a role in the everyday life of scientists. Throughout the class, students wrestle with questions, such as: How is science rhetorical? What can rhetorical analysis reveal about the ways that scientists use persuasion?
