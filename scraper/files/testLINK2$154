{"course_name": "TransMedia Aesthetics and Technology", "description": "Emerging industries in entertainment, visualization and simulation require that data be communicated to audiences in well-designed formats that speak to the specific needs of the user. This class will focus on the design and implementation of digital tools to create a range of interactive displays for multi-platform devices. Digital Publishing, Historical Visualization, Interactive Education, and Data Communication are just a fraction of possibilities for the use of game engine technology. Students will be introduced to creating interactive environments using a variety of artist friendly technology. Through a hands-on approach, students will combine narrative, sound, animation and digital graphics to create an interactive 3D user-experience for use on the web or mobile screen. Unity3, Cinema 4D and components of Adobe Creative Suite will be used as the primary tools of the course. In completing the course, students will have taken design treatments through the process of game level building and porting out to a mobile platform such as the iPhone.\n\r      ", "classification": "MGFX1-GC", "grading": "GC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '7.00 PM', 'end': '9.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "No Class Nov. 20", "instructors": ["Benton, John"], "component": "Laboratory", "number": "2250", "loc_code": "MT", "session": {"start": "09/04/2014", "end": "12/18/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
