Case studies of countries are used to study justice (trials, reparations, lustration, truth and reconciliation, international criminal court and universal jurisdiction) and state building after human rights violations and/or genocides. Particular attention is paid to the social, political, cultural and economic contexts of justice and state building after human rights violations and/or genocide. First, we focus on the use of prosecution, trials and reparations as tools for justice and state building projects in post- Nazi Germany. Second, we analyze the truth and reconciliation and state building in post-apartheid South Africa. Third, we trace the concurrent jurisdiction approach to justice (tribunal-national trials-Gacaca) and state building in post-conflict Rwanda. Fourth, we examine the use of the International Criminal Court as a justice and state building tool in Cambodia.  Finally, we will analyze the justice and state building projects in countries chosen by students in the class.", "instructors": ["Dixon, Jo"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "252", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "GCASL 279", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Law and Society", "description": "An introduction to the study of law as a political practice. We treat law as a political practice from multiple disciplinary standpoints, examining how law and a range of legal institutions embody and constitute political, cultural, economic, and social forces. We examine the mobilization of rights, the use of litigation, and vernacular legal discourse, largely within the context of the United States, but with reference to transnational struggles. In the course of doing so, we study the relationship between making social policy and the use of litigation by social movements. Specifically, we study litigation strategies at the appellate and trial levels by focusing on three sociolegal movements: the civil rights movement, the women?s movement, and class action tort cases.
