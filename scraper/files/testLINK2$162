The region is especially important at this juncture in history due to its rich natural resource base, fragile political and economic situation following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the region?s location in relation to its closest neighbors, Russia and China.  Since 1991, many governments, non-governmental organizations and investors have actively tried to engage the region through international development assistance around the support for democratic institution building and most critically, in and around the direction of energy supply and security.  \n\nThe year 1991 was pivotal in that it officially severed the relationship between Moscow and the republics that comprised what was the Soviet Union.  Since then, the region is engaged in a difficult process of transition, renewal, and redefinition.  It is vital in this connection to consider the ?historical residue? in Central Asia, where centuries of migrations, colonization, and war have created a unique ethnic, religious and cultural mix of peoples and ideologies. \n\nThis special seminar introduces students to the region of Central Asia with a brief historical overview and a look at each of the five states, and then moves towards developing a more in-depth look at the energy sector with specific attention to the energy rich Caspian and its key player, Kazakhstan.

{"course_name": "Conflict Assessment:  Theory and Practice", "description": "International actors often apply different methodologies to assess conflicts. These methodologies help them determine the best ways to address a conflict and maximize their opportunities to prevent or alleviate crises. This course examines how international actors including the World Bank, UN agencies, bilateral donors and NGOs, analyze conflict and the interaction between conflict dynamics and their own engagement in a given country or region. The class will explore how analytical frameworks can be used to assess the impact of development, humanitarian and peacebuilding programs or projects on existing conflict factors and dynamics. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the concept of conflict assessment, its development and implementation; exploring different approaches to conflict assessment, including an examination of different implicit assumptions and theories of conflict; analyzing specific conflict case studies and identifying real and potential third party responses.\n\r      ", "classification": "GLOB1-GC", "grading": "GC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.30 PM', 'end': '9.10 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "PREREQUISITE: GLOB1-GC 1010.", "instructors": ["Hill, Thomas"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2005", "loc_code": "WW", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
