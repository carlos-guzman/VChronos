{"course_name": "The Future of Human Resource Management:  Innovation", "description": "In many fields of endeavor practitioners can point to innovation and \u201cnew technology\u201d as the drivers for great new accomplishments. So what will be the \u201cnew technologies\u201d of Human Resources Management? What innovations in this field will be so new, so fundamentally different, that business leaders will be inclined to say, \u201c\u2026 this changes everything!\u201d? This course will focus on fundamental innovation in Human Resources Management and in general management, in response to the rapidly changing external environment. We will focus on new ideas, processes, and programs. Not on new ways to deliver the same old ideas. This course will also consider innovative ways of thinking about business challenges. To develop innovations in human resources management, we may well need to expand the way we think. This course will certainly not provide all of the answers. But it is critically important to think about the future and to raise the questions. The HR field has focused a lot on \u201cbest practices,\u201d but has it really strived for innovation? \u201cBest practices\u201d can only advance your organization to the point of \u201cbest already in use.\u201d Is that really enough of a competitive advantage?  As the University\u2019s web site notes, New York University has a recognized tradition of innovation. That tradition goes back to NYU\u2019s founding in the early 1800s. Inventor and first NYU Professor of Painting and Sculpture, Samuel F.B. Morse had a laboratory in NYU\u2019s original building, now the location of the Silver Center for Arts and Science. Samuel Morse developed the Morse code and the electrical mechanism to transmit it. We hope to foster a strong spirit of innovation in our own students.\n\r      ", "classification": "HRCM1-GC", "grading": "GC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.00 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '6.00 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2350", "loc_code": "MT", "session": {"start": "2 10/20/20", "end": "- 12/13/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "100"}

Students will be encouraged to actively apply these concepts to their own past, present, and prospective professional circumstances. Upon successfully completing this course students will have mastered the basic fundamentals of, and perspectives on, diversity and inclusion, various aspects of building trustworthy teams, as well as their impact on inclusive activities and other organizational activities.

Teams are expected to establish objectives, plan their strategy, and then make the required decisions dictated by these plans. Typical decision variables involve wages, replacing employees, hiring, promoting from within, training cost for promotions, fringe benefits, budget for other activities, safety, employee participation programs, grievances, human resources information systems, performance appraisal programs, affirmative action program, production levels, overtime, employee morale, turnover, and absenteeism. It is anticipated that this course will be team-taught so that the student will learn to understand and appreciate the many different facets of the strategic role that HR occupies in an organization. In order to expose the students to diverse, real-life situations, industry experts representing the various HR functions in an organization will present actual problem scenarios for the students to analyze, solve and present their findings. Subsequent discussions will introduce the students to how these situations were actually resolved. Finally, students will be required to submit a detailed, written report on a case study analyzed over the course of the semester.\n\r      ", "classification": "HRCM1-GC", "grading": "GC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.00 AM', 'end': '5.00 PM', 'day': 'Sat'}]", "notes": "6 Sessions, 10/25 -12/6 no class 11/29.", "instructors": ["Banks, Ronald"], "component": "Laboratory", "number": "4000", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "2 10/25/20", "end": "- 12/06/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "10.00 AM - 5.00 PM", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "100"}

In addition to examining the relationship between finance and the other strategic functions in the organization, particular emphasis will be placed on the impact that finance has on shaping technology-related decisions. At the end of the course, students will be expected to have learned the fundamental financial tools and techniques necessary to be an effective strategic manager. The goal is for students to understand a company's decision-making opportunities and processes, and apply these techniques to real-life financial decisions. Topics include (but are not limited to) accounting/finance theories and concepts; financial statement analysis; budgeting, forecasting and variance analysis; capital budgeting and project analysis; cash flow analysis; and time value of money. Students will learn fundamental financial concepts through real-world group assignments, problem solving and term projects. The student who successfully completes this course will have the ability to: understand basic fundamental concepts and principles of finance/accounting and how they are used to create financial reports; analyze financial statements and recognize their importance; use discounted cash flow analysis to analyze competing projects; use modeling techniques for budgeting, forecasting and benchmarking analysis and applications.\n\r      ", "classification": "HRCM1-GC", "grading": "GC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.30 PM', 'end': '9.30 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Lecture", "number": "1220", "loc_code": "DR", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/13/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "", "units": "3", "is_open": true, "section": "200"}

{"course_name": "Business Strategy & Ethics", "description": "Strategy is the heart and soul of any business.  The essence of business strategy is to understand your organization?s uniqueness and order-winning criteria. This course will focus on how classic strategy paradigms such as differentiation; brand creation; core competency expertise; speed to market; value migration and leadership in the areas of cost reduction, technology and innovation are linked to a sustained competitive advantage.  In addition, the course will examine how changes in the competitive landscape such as globalization, the rapid diffusion of technology, excess capacity, shifting marketplace demographics, increasing cost transparencies, the erosion of pricing power and the commoditization and unbundling of products/services; are creating both problems and unique opportunities.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the ethical dilemmas that confront managers due to advances in technology, greater access to information, and more collaborative ventures that break down traditional proprietary boundaries. Given the recent wave of ethical lapses in business, students will be sensitized to the ethical considerations in any given decision-making scenario. Utilizing lectures, assigned readings, small group projects, case studies and simulations, the students will become proficient at business strategy analysis, creation and implementation within an ethical framework.  A final class project will involve the creation of an Individualized Business Strategy Analysis and Action Plan, which applies the techniques learned during the course to any business selected by the student.  Upon successful completion of the course, students will be expected to understand classic and innovative strategy paradigms and how to formulate and implement them under ethical guidelines.
