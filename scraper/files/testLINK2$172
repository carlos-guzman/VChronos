{"course_name": "Developmental Psychology", "description": "This course traces the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of children from birth through adolescence. Emphasis is placed on the complex ways in which biological predispositions, the family, and broader cultural and socioeconomic influences interact in shaping the child's character and psychological adjustment at successive stages of development. Students gain familiarity with traditional and contemporary theories of human development and the research methods used by developmental psychologists. Special attention is given to recent findings on the importance of early attachment relationships and to the emerging field of developmental psychopathology. Course readings are supplemented by video, classroom demonstrations, and individual research projects.\n\r      ", "classification": "PSYC1-UC", "grading": "UC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '8.50 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "Prerequisite: Introduction to Psychology  15 SESSIONS.\nNOT OPEN TO STEINHARDT STUDENTS.\nFALL 2014", "instructors": ["Oster, Harriet"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "6848", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/03/2014", "end": "12/17/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "WAVE 567", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

The course reviews principles of psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis, legal terminology, the court system, and constitutional amendments. Specific issues include competency (to stand trial, to waive rights, to represent oneself, to be sentenced and to be executed); legal insanity; mental status at the time of an offense; sentencing and alternatives to incarceration; and treatment and services available to special criminal justice populations. The class also examines juvenile delinquency, sexual offenders, and aspects of family law and civil forensics such as child custody, competence for making a will, and refusing medication.

Course readings examine the influences of genetic predispositions and risk factors such as stress, depression, hostility, and abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Equally important are factors that play a role in maintaining health and well-being, such as positive attitudes, exercise, supportive family relationships, and social support. The course familiarizes students with the diverse settings in which health psychologists work and with the scientific methods used in this field, including behavioral research and research in neuropsychology and psychoneuroimmunology on the effects of stress on the brain and immune system.
