{"course_name": "Human Biology", "description": "This course focuses on the biological events that take place in the human body. It discusses such fundamental processes as cellular respiration and the role of DNA as the source of genetic inheritance. Other lecture topics include the internal organization of the human body; cell structure and functions; stem cells and their medical potential; tissues; and skin. Students also study the physiology of the digestive system and nutrition, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, blood, and the reproductive system. As appropriate, laboratory work is used to complement and reinforce the lecture material.\n\r      ", "classification": "SCNC1-UC", "grading": "UC SCPS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '8.50 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "FALL 2014 - NO CLASS 10/14/13 - FALL BREAK", "instructors": ["Riftina, Faina"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2001", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/16/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "School of Continuing and Professional Studies", "location": "GCASL 379", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
