{"course_name": "What is Memory", "description": "The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as \u201cHow is memory embodied?\u201d How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self--and with language and story-telling-- and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students will come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that will serve their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed.\n\r      ", "classification": "UNDSW-US", "grading": "Ugrd Silver Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.30 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "Cross listed with AHSEM-UA 187.001 and ENGL-UA 252.002.", "instructors": ["Rust, Martha"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "79", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Silver School of Social Work", "location": "GODD B06", "units": "3", "is_open": false, "section": "001"}
