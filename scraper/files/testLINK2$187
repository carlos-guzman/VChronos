{"course_name": "Art & Ideas: What is Social Practice Art?", "description": "This course explores the burgeoning field of social practice art. Today artists working in the field of social practice focus on aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, media strategies, &amp; social activism as central issues that inform their artworks &amp; projects that are designed for public &amp; social spaces. In the United States, visual art that engaged the public directly began in the late 1950s &amp; coincided with the local \u201cdecentralization\u201d efforts that, in the arts, resulted in community-based art practices that envisioned the public as diverse, socially-engaged, &amp; contributed to an expansive aesthetic consciousness. Understanding this history contextualizes social practice art &amp; allows us to interrogate the ways artists blur the lines between object making, performance, activism, grass roots organizing &amp; pedagogy.\n\r      ", "classification": "ARTCR-GE", "grading": "Grad Steinhardt Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '4.55 PM', 'end': '6.35 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Desai, Dipti"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2459", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development - Graduate", "location": "BARN 403", "units": "6", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
