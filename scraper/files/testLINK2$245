It will do so by focusing on self-identified black playwrights who take ownership over US history and also US theatrical history, challenging expected notions of both.  These works reflect the social changes (civil rights, the cold war) and aesthetic changes (absurdism, postmodernism, postcolonialism, hip hop) of the time period.  As a result, they chart not a single black experience but multiple black perspectives.  Representative texts include Alice Childress's Wine in the Wilderness, Adrienne Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, George Wolfe's The Colored Museum, and Thomas Bradshaw's Southern Promises.

The story takes place during the times of the pogroms (or mass slaughter and riots against the Jews) in Eastern Europe. Jews were being accused of blood lybel or of killing Christian children and drinking their blood during Passover. This and other false tales caused mass slaughter in riots against the Jews from terrified Christians. Jews were ostracized and it was a terrible time. The Maharal, or leading rabbi, did the forbidden and created a monster to protect the Jews, and many different stories take place as to what ways the Golem took down which devious enemies. He is a sacred superhero and it is known that the author of Frankenstein took the model for her character from the Golem. The class will explore many of the versions of the story and the time in which it took place, but also and even more importantly, it will explore how to create a horror story, how to scare audiences, and what is the dynamic of a superhero taking over a demon. We will listen to music, read stories, look at old movies, and create our own moments of horror and no doubt in some cases, comedy. Students will be required to read, write, compose, and perform. It is not a guarantee into the production of THE GOLEM which will take place in the spring, but each student will have had an important part in the creation of the show, and certainly a good chance at being involved directly in the StageWorks production.

This workshop-cum-seminar will engage with key themes in recent \u201cpost-humanist\u201d discourse by applying and testing them in our own creative practice.  We will read recent theories of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors, Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter, Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear, Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo). Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space, objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic implications of these theoretical ideas.   A main interest of this course is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making as well as by thinking/writing/speaking.

We will trace notions of spectacle and surveillance prior to the advent of electronic media, such as Aristotle\u2019s notion of opsis and the role of spying in early modern European drama. We will then consider how the rise of mass media further institutionalized spectacle and surveillance both conceptually and materially. Critical literature will include the work of Guy Debord, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, and Samuel Weber. Finally, the course will examine contemporary artists that incorporate questions of surveillance and spectacle as the basis for their own work.

We will approach the major avant-garde movements, including European Symbolism, Expressionism, Futurism, Surrealism, Dada, the Bauhaus, and Constructivism, as systematic means devised by avant-garde artists to reexamine and redefine the possibilities of theatre. We will also engage multicultural formations of the avant-garde, considering works from outside Europe and the US and interrogating what James Harding problematizes as the notion of the \u201ccutting edge.\u201d  We will also critically engage the theoretical underpinnings of the avant-garde as we consider its relation to modernism\u2014including the semantic origins of avant-garde in French military terminology\u2014and, subsequently, postmodernism.  Taking note of simultaneous developments in visual art, dance, music, and cinema to reflect their impact on and by theatre, we will also place artistic innovation within a broader sociopolitical and cultural context, including the Industrial Revolution, shifts in political and psychological ideologies, and the long-term effects of globalization on artistic production and reception. Throughout our study, we will ask ourselves: What comprises the \u201cavant-garde\u201d and does it still exist?; What is our relation, as students, performers, writers, and directors, to the historical avant-garde?; and How do the works of the historical avant-garde affect our engagement with contemporary theatre and performance today?

{"course_name": "Modern US Drama", "description": "Specific institutions in United States culture have captured the playwright's imagination throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. Whether or not these institutions are revered or  criticized by art, they are often the foundational structures that shape an American's private and public experiences, one's work life (\"employment\"), and domestic life (\"marriage,\" \"family\"). Certainly, the nation's super-structures influence each one's lives, directly or indirectly-such as government (federal, state, local), military, the church, education, and entertainment. This course analyzes institutional structures and their impact on the diverse theatrical representations of individualization and community produced in and by a democratic society. We will look at conventional and experimental theatre--from canonized to under-represented work-created by a wide range of artists. Among the playwrights under consideration: Glaspell, Crothers, O'Neill, Stein, Treadwell, Odets, Saroyan, Wilder, Williams, Miller, Wright/Green, Albee, Kennedy, Fornes, Mamet, Pinero, Shanley, Houston, Parks, Wilson, Kushner, Cruz, Smith, Hoch, Jones, Forbes, Power, Beaty, The Group Theatre, Open Theatre, Wooster Group, Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Split Britches, Five Lesbian Brothers, Universes, and  Elevator Repair Service. Among the critics: Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche, DuBois, Fanon, Althuser, Foucault, Butler, Savran, Diamond, Delbanco, Roediger, and Elam.

Among the playwrights under consideration: Glaspell, Crothers, O'Neill, Stein, Treadwell, Odets, Saroyan, Wilder, Williams, Miller, Wright/Green, Albee, Kennedy, Fornes, Mamet, Pinero, Shanley, Houston, Parks, Wilson, Kushner, Cruz, Smith, Hoch, Jones, Forbes, Power, Beaty, The Group Theatre, Open Theatre, Wooster Group, Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Split Britches, Five Lesbian Brothers, Universes, and  Elevator Repair Service. Among the critics: Plato, Aristotle, Nietzsche, DuBois, Fanon, Althuser, Foucault, Butler, Savran, Diamond, Delbanco, Roediger, and Elam. Our semester's question: To what extent does US drama and performance reinscribe institutional \"policy\"/conventions or radically intervene in an effort to overturn familiar paradigms in favor of new representations and theatricalities?

Majors Only\nThis course looks at the development of SITE-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE in the US with a special emphasis on projects that directly involve specific communities. \u201cSite-specific\u201d is a term frequently associated with the visual arts but since the Happenings of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, a body of work termed \u201csite-specific performance\u201d has evolved as highly structured works of art that are designed around, for or because of place. In the streets, in fields, deserts, forests, garbage dumps, abandoned buildings, on the border, aboard boats, in virtual space and outer space, this genre has unleashed the power of performance to indelibly mark our notion of place.  In taking performance out of conventional venues, new strategies and outcomes have been defined. As site artists confront the matrix of social forces and overlapping communities that relate to a given site, their aesthetics, creative process and goals have shifted. What is new about these performances?  Where have they taken place? How are they blurring the lines between art and activism, art and urban renewal, art and spirituality, art and real life? How are they being funded? How have they challenged the segregated nature of art in America as separate from community?  We will look historically at some of the pioneers in this field from Allan Kaprow, Anna Halprin, Meredith Monk and will also explore the latest developments in the field utilizing new forms of technology. Video viewings of contemporary site-specific performance works (Anne Bogart, Ann Carlson/Mary Ellen Strom, Tamar Rogoff, Deborah Warner and others) will be augmented by readings including excerpts from Suzanne Lacy\u2019s Mapping the Terrain; New Genre Public Art, Lucy Lippard\u2019s The Lure of the Local, One Place After Another: Site Specific Art and Locational Identity by Miwon Kwon and articles from the Community Arts Network website. Students will be assigned up to four, 2 page papers that respond to readings or videos. Combining theory with practice, students will be creating short performance and/or media pieces based on site inquiries and community engagement assignments. The course will culminate in a final research paper on a seminal artist in the field.

It will look at the changing role of ritual in the region, from the qhapaq hucha of the Incas to the colonial fiestas of Spanish America. With the advent of Spanish imperialism we will explore how theater was deployed as part of a larger project of evangelization and colonization. The latter part of the course will examine performance culture in colonial Latin America in the context of the Spanish empire through dramatic texts by Sor Juana, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. Central to our discussions will be the relationship between ritual and theater, coloniality and power, and the emergence of baroque culture in the Americas. \n (Theatre Studies C)", "instructors": ["Calderon, Sebastian", "Calderon, Sebastian"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "748", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "SILV 621", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

{"course_name": "Realism & Naturalism", "description": "This course will examine the primarily 19th century European movement toward Realism and Naturalism that remains a major influence in today's theater, shaping both dramatic practice and audience expectation. The question of how to define these sometimes synonymous and often divergent terms will be tackled head-on, leading to a recognition that neither can be separated from each other or from the larger historical and theoretical context from which they arose. We will look at the relationship of Realism and Naturalism to the philosophical climate of the 1800s (Hegel, Darwin, Marx, Freud), to other theatrical movements (Romanticism, Symbolism, Expressionism and Aestheticism), to contemporaneous dramatic and literary forms (melodrama, the well-made play, the novel, photography), and to concrete historical trends (the rise of nation states, changing sex roles and family structures). The course focuses on the plays of the major European dramatists who defined the movement (Zola, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Shaw), and tentatively traces its transformation in early to middle 20th century American drama. The inevitable question as to whether \"the real\" and \"the natural\" can ever be truly represented will be faced, but not at the expense of failing to ask what may or may not be gained from the attempt.

The theatre of the Renaissance pushes at the boundaries of socially acceptable behavior and represents anxiety about the role of women and sexuality in a world that both celebrates and abhors sexually \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior. The course will explore how plays of each of the regions operate in dialogue with one another, exploring the same themes and mythologies. Each segment will explore plays from Italy, Spain and England that surround the theme, along with critical essays to better understand historical context and contemporary scholarship. The course will be broken down into three segments: Cross-dressing; Rape in Renaissance Drama; and Marriage Infidelity and Murder.
