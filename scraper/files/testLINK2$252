{"course_name": "Poetics of Witnessing", "description": "Today, many documentarians consider themselves working within a well-defined human rights framework where images and film are used to raise awareness about social injustice. On the far edge of this movement, however, there are writers, photographers and filmmakers whose work calls attention to the traditional documentary ethics of bearing witness but whose modes of representation blur the lines between fact and fiction. This body of work is more open-ended to interpretation and multiple readings, which also include more personal themes such as loss and melancholy, the ephemeral nature of time and memory, nostalgia and change.\n \nWe will study several different kinds of visual poetics such as combining documentary photos with literature, artists working with archives and found images, the personal essay film, ethnographic poetics, photo reportage and new media visual storytelling, mixed media and public projections. Some of the writers and artists we will study include Alfredo Jaar, W.G. Sebald, Chris Marker, Christian Boltanski, Forough Farrokhzad, Susan Sontag, Marcelo Brodsky, Roland Barthes, Miguel Rio Branco, Alexander Sokurov, Lorna Simpson, Jean Rouch, Susan Meiselas, Jonas Mekas.\n\r      ", "classification": "OART-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '5.00 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Lucas, Peter"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "2829", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Tisch School of the Arts", "location": "7E12 127", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
