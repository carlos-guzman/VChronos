{"course_name": "Web Design", "description": "This course introduces students to the basics of web design. Students will learn elementary coding using xHTML and CSS using Adobe Dreamweaver. Concepts such as effective design, usability, organization of content, and web publishing will be discussed. Our main focus will be on conceptual and aesthetic aspects of designing for the web. Skills will be developed and demonstrated through the execution of studio and homework web design projects. Works will be critiqued in class to enhance the development of creative and analytical skills. Course Objectives: upon completion of this course, students will: 1. Know how to create basic web pages using xHTML and CSS, 2. Become comfortable using Dreamweaver to aid in web design and construction, 3. Gain an understanding of the unique design problems involved in web design, 4. Develop an ability to design and problem-solve through the creation of their own projects, and 5. Evaluate and explore effective web-based design and the web as a medium. There is a lab fee charged for this course.\n\r      ", "classification": "PHTI-GT", "grading": "Grad Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.30 AM', 'end': '1.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "SAME AS H82.0038 H99.8238.  Prerequisite: Photography & Imaging: Analog, Digital, and Multimedia. Working knowledge of Photoshop\nrequired.\n\nThis class explores visual communication and design concepts as applied to web and screen based environments. Consideration will be given to layout, type, image, motion and video, principles of organizational hierarchy, interaction, context, and audience. We will also look at the culture of the web, social media and blogging, emerging ideas, thoughtful topics, insights and provocations. It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be designing for the web. Content can take center stage. Advances in web browsers and standards, and smart thinking allow us to finally embrace web design as its own thing. We\u2019re no longer forced to think of the web as a digital reproduction of physical pages. Modern websites can be intelligently malleable projects\u2014adaptable and responsive to a broad continuum of uses and devices from 27\" screens to your iPhone. Responsive web design allow sites to gracefully adapt to any number of circumstances. These recent advances can seem overwhelming to keep up with: HTML5, CSS3, responsive web design, mobile, web fonts and grids. It seems impossible to keep up with everything. Does your content travel well? Can your design and functionality survive from one platform to another or one browser to another? This class will take it slowly. We will build our web skills through a series of weekly exercises, with one midterm project and one final project. Topics explored will include: \n\u2022\tDesign and layout\n\u2022\tTypography and web fonts\n\u2022\tUser interface design\n\u2022\tCreativity and process\n\u2022\tResponsive web design\n\u2022\tXHTML and HTML5 (The web\u2019s new and future markup language)\n\u2022\tCascading Style Sheets (CSS) as part of standards-based web design\n\u2022\tBrowsers and devices from large screen to mobile\n\u2022\tJquery\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that great design is bigger than well-chosen typefaces, sharp images, harmonious color palettes, and pixel-perfect grid systems. Those are merely some of the ingredients needed to support a great project with great content. Remember if the content is not interesting and meaningful, its just an empty shell. Form follows function every time.\n\nElizabeth Kilroy is an award-winning multimedia designer with a background in graphic design, theater and installation.
