Students will also learn techniques to improve their own performance skills and to develop a solid foundation and methodology for critiquing and guiding the artists they may ultimately work with in their own professional careers.  Student presentations will be video-taped and critiqued, with an eye toward developing a stage presence and aesthetic, congruent with their desired artistic and/or commercial effect. Along the lines of Berry Gordy\u2019s Motown model but with an eye to the present and the future, students will be introduced to visual presentation issues (fashion, lighting, body movement, choreography, etc) and interacting with and nurturing an audience. There will be a case study component of artistic practices and theatrical traditions as practiced by established performers.

{"course_name": "Topics in Recorded Music: Bob Marley & Postcolonial Music", "description": "Often described as \u201ca prophet,\u201d the pioneer Bob Marley transcended the genre he helped develop, Jamaican reggae, to become a musical and revolutionary leader of the 20th Century.  On the way, the bi-racial Marley smashed restrictions of race and class imposed on his generation by the colonial system. How did Marley, an effectively fatherless child from a tiny village, achieve his rise to global authority and influence, musically, socio-politically, spiritually, personally and in terms of the industry? Vivien Goldman was Bob Marley\u2019s trusted chronicler and has written two books about him. We will examine the history of Jamaica, its culture and connection with Britain; Marley\u2019s evolution as a writer and musician; his creative partnerships with artists like The Wailers and dubmaster Lee Perry; his lifelong battle to control the business of his music; and his commitment to pan-Africanism and Rasta as a way of life.

{"course_name": "Topics in Recorded Music: Aretha Franklin and Soul Music", "description": "In the world of popular music, the word ?soul? has come to mean so many things ? a style, a sound, an attitude, a way of singing, a way of belonging. And a way of categorizing music for the sake of bringing it to market. Yet, there was a time that ?soul? referred to a very specific kind of music in a very specific time and place.\r\n\r\nThis course will trace the exciting history of soul music and the enduring culture that sprang from it, beginning with the rise of rhythm and blues in the ?50s, through the turbulent ?60s, to its crowning moment in 1967 with the arrival of its best-known avatar, the Queen of Soul -- Aretha Franklin. Through reading, discussion, listening sessions, guest speakers and video presentations, we will consider: the various definitions of ?soul?, the roots of soul music and the stars of the style. How the music reflected the social and political spirit of the ?60s, and predicted the triumphant future of black music in America. How the consideration of soul music necessarily raises issues of racial identity, conflict, and dialogue. How the continuing dialogue between white and black America takes place in a musical arena that we still label ?soul?. We will also trace the gospel birth, ?pop? musical development, and explosive arrival of Aretha Franklin ? the ?Natural Woman? whose voice delivered Soul into mainstream popularity and brought African American authenticity into the popular realm. We will look at the many ways that soul music morphed after the ?60s,giving rise to  black musical styles like funk, disco, and hip hop, and focus on the evolving relationship of soul music and American race relations as well. This path of inquiry will offer a means to understanding the continuing impact of the music and culture of the soul era, as well as Ms. Franklin?s continuing reign.\n\r      ", "classification": "REMU-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.00 PM', 'end': '3.00 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "This course meets the first half of the semester, from September 2 - October 21.

By the end of the course, students have the necessary skills to communicate with and produce excellence from musical performers in the recording studio. To that end, this course instructs students in the selection of appropriate musical material, arrangement of the material, the construction of the sound in the studio, and the artistic ensemble of the recorded sound on the completed album. Working first in small groups and then individually, students gain practical experience by recording and mixing sound with professional artists in the studio, under careful supervision. In preparation for the third year, students are asked to consider possible distribution modes for the final product and a range of identifiable publics.  This class also arms students with a working knowledge of the recording techniques of specific genres of popular music. We analyze the recorded repertoire of a diverse range of genres?such as rock, pop, R &amp; B, hip-hop, jazz, blues, country, and electronica?as time permits and according to student needs. Students are asked to purchase a number of ?classic? albums in the genre in which they intend to pursue their work, and they deconstruct those albums for aural clues to imagine how they might have been put together in the studio.

{"course_name": "Topics in Recorded Music: Diasporic Sounds", "description": "In the early modern era, the movement, migration, and dispossession of Europeans and Africans to the \u201cNew World\u201d encouraged the transmission of diverse cultural practices within new contexts. In particular, the \u201cAfrican Diaspora\u201d was forged, as multiple tribes and ethnicities were forcibly transported throughout the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. In the Americas, varied forms of traditional African life and culture were both preserved and transformed within the confines of enslavement, while distinct ethnic practices converged in newly formed communities and settings, as well as in relation to (ethnic) European Diasporic practices. The topics of this course will travel across the Atlantic and three centuries, as we explore how the sounds of the African Diaspora have been (per)formed, transmitted, circulated, and commodified within the development of popular sounds in the Americas. Diasporic Sounds will begin by engaging the spiritual, improvisatory, rhythmic, and corporeal aspects of how sounds of the African Diaspora were (re)created throughout the New World. Focusing on the United States, the Caribbean, and Brazil, this course will continue to explore the ways in which these diasporic sounds both related and differed across regions and contexts, reflecting the diversity implicit within how we investigate (Africa\u2019s) Diaspora. While the course considers the specific contexts of Africans throughout the Americas, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between identity and popular sound by considering how sounds of the African Diaspora became thematized, commodified, and circulated in the context of an increasingly industrial and globalized world economy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As we explore the range, singularity, and hybridity of (African) Diasporic sounds, we will also cover a number of genres and their performers, including (but not limited to) the folk spiritual of the U.S., Haitian Compas, blackface minstrelsy, samba, Hip Hop, Bomba, Cuban jazz, and reggaeton, in addition to styles such as bluegrass, techno, and British soul.\n\r      ", "classification": "REMU-UT", "grading": "Ugrd Tisch Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '3.30 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "This course meets the second half of the semester, from October 22 - December 12.

{"course_name": "Music Theory for Producers", "description": "This 14-week music theory course is geared toward producers with an emphasis on a no-nonsense and demystifying presentation of the basics of music theory.

This course will examine the roots of the music industry, how it grew and developed into a multi-billion dollar industry, and where it is headed.

{"course_name": "Record Producer as Creative Artist", "description": "This class investigates record producing as an art form. Record producers like Brian Eno, Glyn Johns, Quincy Jones, Tom Dowd, and Missy Elliott are as much creative artists as they are entrepreneurs. We look at different types of producers and production styles in rock, pop, hip-hop, and R &amp; B. Some producers we may discuss include Phil Spector, George Martin, Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and the Bomb Squad. The goal of the class is for students to successfully analyze the quality of production in a given piece of popular music.
