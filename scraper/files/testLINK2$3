While adolescence is physically the healthiest period of the lifespan, it is also marked by an enormous rise in morbidity and mortality.

At the turn of the twentieth century, adolescence was described as a developmental period inevitably filled with \u201cstorm and stress.\u201d In what ways does this vision of adolescence still apply? How should current scientific findings inform our understanding of the propensity for risk-taking behavior during this period (including substance use, increasing sexual activity, and disordered eating)? In exploring the factors that shape emotions, behavior, and emerging identity during adolescence, this course will examine such questions from biological and psychosocial perspectives.\n\r      ", "classification": "CAMS-UA", "grading": "CAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '4.45 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "Open to all students.", "instructors": ["Soffer, Jocelyn"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "142", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "12WV L113", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
