{"course_name": "Making Virtual Sense: 3 D Graphic Studio for Critically-Driven Creative Applications", "description": "Until recently, the creation of interactive 3D graphics was only possible for large and capital-intensive uses: the armed forces, large-scale architectural/engineering work, mass entertainment. Now, open-source applications and powerful personal and portable computers are making it practical for individuals and small groups to independently build and share alternative visions. Whether you are interested in exploring new ways to construct complex networks of ideas in the present, or to imagine physical spaces to reflect and support new ways of life, this arts workshop provides a blend of critical orientation and hands-on experience. In this open project studio, the majority of course time and work will be taken up with the development of student-built individual or small team concepts, to be developed as 3D graphic \"fly-through\" models. Theoretical discussions will be initiated with a mix of relevant writings and media. Here is a representative sampling of sources: Douglas Engelbart, Eric Raymond, William Gibson, Zaha Hadid, Judith Donath, the Athenian Acropolis, the Kalachakra mandala, Salisbury Cathedral, the Schindler house, Artigas gardens, the 1958 World's fair Philips pavilion, the Seagram's building, Grant Theft Auto IV, the monastery of La Tourette, the Mangin plan, compendium.org, Betaville.\n\r      ", "classification": "ARTS-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '6.10 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "INSTRUCTOR: CARL SKELTON", "instructors": ["Skelton, Carl"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1647", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "EDUC 2FL", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Something to Sing About: Acting in Musical Theatre", "description": "The \u201cAmerican Musical\u201d as it has evolved over the last century has become a remarkable model of interdisciplinary practice. From its early iterations and influences in burlesque, vaudeville, and operetta to the complex contemporary amalgams of book, music, lyrics, and dance, the American musical has proven a rich crucible for the exploration of identity and culture, form and content, and ideas and emotions. This arts workshop will offer actors a technical foundation for acting in musical theater. We will deal broadly with the history of musical theater in context by exploring both the process by which actors engage with musical material and the development and aesthetics of the form. Participants will work on songs and scenes taken from the giants of musical theater including: Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein, Kander &amp; Ebb, Stephen Sondheim, and more. How do we merge the receiving nature of acting with the giving nature of singing? How do we \u201cjustify\u201d the decision to sing at all? Our survey of the evolution of musical theater will ask: What does the history of the American musical tell us about our cultural history? What do musicals teach us about the interdisciplinary nature of living in the arts? All students in this course must be comfortable and confident singing actors. Everyone will be required to rehearse outside of class time, complete written and analytical assignments, and commit to a public presentation at the end of the semester.

The differences and similarities of these mediums will be investigated, via such works as Neil Simon\u2019s The Odd Couple, successful in all forms\u2014stage, film, and TV sitcom. Structure, function and form will be examined via the reading of scripts and viewing of films and classic TV. Students will spend ten weeks of the semester creating, developing, and writing a sitcom episode of a classic television series, such as I Love Lucy. Students will learn first-hand what it takes to complete a writing assignment from pitch, to beat sheet, outline, first draft, rewrite, to table draft, under the direct supervision and guidance of an executive producer. In this way, students will learn the business of the TV writer and what it takes to be successful in \u201cthe room\u201d of a Hollywood TV show. Readings may include Writing for Television by Madeline DiMaggio and Laughs, Luck and Lucy! by Jess and Gregg Oppenheimer.

{"course_name": "Architectural Design and Drawing", "description": "This workshop introduces the basic process of creating an architectural design. It begins with an analysis of a building by an established architect. Through diagrams and drawings, issues of form, function, concept, and environment are presented. Visual systems of axis and proportions are also explored, as well as the use of light, color, materials, structure, and historical references. Students learn the visual language of architecture by drafting plans, sections, elevations, and renderings. In the second project, students design a loft space. They begin by creating a concept and program. Planning issues, such as function, circulation and spatial organization are discussed, as well as methods for evaluating a project. Designs are developed through perspectives and isometric images made in Sketchup or hand drawings. Films, lectures, and texts on design theory provide additional insights.

{"course_name": "Sound Art", "description": "We generally assume art to be an engagement with the visual. How does our experience and understanding change when our engagement is primarily through our ears? This arts workshop investigates sound as it comes into play in contemporary visual art practice, installation art, experimental music, and various confluences of these. We will study historical examples of early recording technologies, and explore experimental sound works that provide the intellectual and conceptual antecedents for sound art today. We will also think analytically and historically about the concepts of \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201csilence.\u201d Students will explore the potential of sound as an artistic medium by creating sound-based works as well as studying the work of other artists (John Cage, Pierre Schaeffer, Max Neuhaus, Pauline Oliveros and Iannis Xenakis are some historical touchpoints; Marina Rosenfeld, Christian Marclay, Steven Vitiello, Christina Kubisch, and Susan Philipsz are some contemporary examples). This is not a music or composition class, and the emphasis of this class falls strongly on expanding conceptual skills rather than on technical development. Although experience editing sound is helpful, it is not required. Production assignments are assigned in tandem with with readings of contemporary and historical writing, critical essays and artist\u2019s statements. There will be a strong emphasis placed on discussion, group critique, and student presentations. Guest speakers are a regular part of the course and include artists, curators/critics, and producers of sound who engage the subject from a variety of viewpoints. Ultimately, students in this course will arrive at an enhanced experience of listening such that their knowledge, awareness, and creative engagement with sound is significantly altered.\n\r      ", "classification": "ARTS-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Fri'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Katchadourian, Nina"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1490", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "BOBS LL140", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Emerging new media technologies allow cross-development and implementation to the Internet. Each student brings to the class a set of experiences and skills, such as research, writing, design, film, music, photography, computer gaming, performance, illustration, computer literacy, software knowledge or Internet experience. Through lectures, including a survey of digital new media currently on the Internet, group discussions, field trips and workshops, focusing on their personal skills, students will develop individual projects. The workshop will deconstruct innovative new media instillations, inventions, computer games, film, that use digital new media, as well as discuss concepts, content strategies, and frameworks that bridge theory and practice.
