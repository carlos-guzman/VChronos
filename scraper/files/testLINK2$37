{"course_name": "Proseminar: Theory and Methods in the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives", "description": "This seminar, designed for incoming M.A. students, provides a broad introduction to theories and methods that have shaped the interdisciplinary terrain of the social sciences. The course emphasizes the reading of classic and more contemporary works of social theory and methodology, with a focus on key concepts and thinkers. How does one define a society? What is culture? How have social and cultural processes been understood? What is the relationship between a society or culture and a social group, an institution, or an individual? What is the nature of power, difference and identity? How do such foundational questions generate theories of modernity, capitalism, nationalism and globalization? How do such foundational questions orient the variety of disciplines within the social sciences? The course also surveys qualitative and quantitative methodologies, exploring the relationship between theory, methods, and the broader goals of research within the social sciences.  Empirically grounded writings will explore the links between research frameworks, methodologies, data collection and theoretical claims.  Readings will include classic texts by Karl Marx and Max Weber and more contemporary theorists such as Michel Foucault, David Harvey and Judith Butler, among others. Guest lectures by Gallatin faculty will introduce students to a range of methodologies (ethnography, quantitative data sets, the case study method, documentary analysis, interviewing and survey methods) and interdisciplinary research frameworks.\n\r      ", "classification": "CORE-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Duncombe, Stephen"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2025", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 501", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Proseminar: Theory and Methods in the Arts:  Interdisciplinary Perspectives", "description": "Theory and critique are not only expected from so-called \"serious artists\", they are also being produced and consumed at increasingly rapid rates by students, established artists, historians, critics, and others.  This course will investigate the foundations and developments of art criticism and analysis. Emphasis will be placed on addressing what it means to be \"critical\" and how analysis has been influenced or shaped by critical theory, semiotics and psychoanalysis. The course will consider how these disciplines have been used in the writings and artworks by figures such as Nicolas Bourriaud, Julia Kristeva, Meyer Schapiro, Hans Haake, Mary Kelly, Dan Graham, and Andrea Fraser.  In this instance artistic practice is viewed as involving both creating artworks and writing/theorizing. The course will stress the role of discourse in art while also allowing allowing practitioners to produce and present art projects.\n\r      ", "classification": "CORE-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Mokgosi, Meleko"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2027", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 401", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

{"course_name": "Proseminar: Theory and Methods in the  Humanities:  Traditions or Interpretation", "description": "This interdisciplinary seminar for incoming M.A. students introduces a series of key twentieth and twenty-first century theoretical debates about the subject and object of interpretation in the modern humanities.  The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work.  These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres.  The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world.  The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity.  Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work.  Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek.  Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.\n\r      ", "classification": "CORE-GG", "grading": "Grad Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '9.00 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Romig, Andrew J"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "2026", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "12WV L113", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
