{"course_name": "First-Year Interdiscplinary Seminar: Main Street U.S.A.", "description": "This course will consider Main Street as a physical place and as an idea, examining how the space has come to represent American values and ideals for many. We will draw on a range of primary sources, including novels, plays, advertisements, photographs, and films, as well as secondary sources that model interdisciplinary scholarship, to look at the formation of the Main Street ideal and ways that this space has been shaped by some of the larger shifts in American culture and the across the world during the twentieth century, such as urbanization, suburbanization, globalization, and the modern rights revolution. What are the origins of the Main Street ideal? How and why does it promote a nostalgic view of America? How has it been used to both critique and promote small-town living? Who has access to this space, and who is excluded? How has the idea of Main Street been mobilized to present an image of America to the rest of the world? Our exploration of Main Street will allow us to reflect on a diverse range of topics and themes, including Norman Rockwell images, soda fountains, Disney theme parks, suburbs, the Cold War, and debates contrasting Wall Street and Main Street. Readings and films will include It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, Sherwood Anderson\u2019s Winesburg Ohio, Sinclair Lewis\u2019 Main Street, Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s A Raisin in the Sun, and Richard Yates\u2019 Revolutionary Road.\n\r      ", "classification": "FIRST-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '12.30 PM', 'end': '1.45 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO GALLATIN FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS ONLY.", "instructors": ["Spellacy, Amy", "Spellacy, Amy"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "82", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 527", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

{"course_name": "First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: Double, Double", "description": "What happens when we look out into the world and find our own face staring back? An encounter with a double is an intimation of immortality, of the body\u2019s survival beyond its limits, which reminds the self of its own demise. A double is also the outward projection of internal division, a copy that displaces the original, continuity that tears the fabric of rationality. This class will explore the ambivalence of the double by examining its repeated appearances in literature, photography and film, psychoanalysis and critical theory. We will consider doubling as magic, a practice of making resemblances that live a borrowed life. Freud\u2019s theory of the uncanny explains the double as our confrontation with what we failed to keep hidden from ourselves, the return of the repressed. In Gogol, the double comes on the scene as a social cipher, a grotesque embodiment of the self\u2019s alienated and dehumanized condition. In photography and film, doubling defines the very nature of the medium, which simultaneously copies the world and causes it to disappear. We will consider the camera itself as a double, a mechanical eye that positions the viewer\u2019s gaze and projects it onto the film. Students will write several analytic essays exploring these views of the double through close readings of texts on the syllabus. Readings may include essays by Freud, Barthes, Taussig, Kofman, and Mulvey; fiction and poetry by Gogol, Stevenson, Conrad, Woolf, Barnes, Borges, and Howe; photography and films by Brassai, Arbus, and Marker.\n\r      ", "classification": "FIRST-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '7.35 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '6.20 PM', 'end': '7.35 PM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO GALLATIN FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS ONLY.", "instructors": ["Vydrin, Eugene", "Vydrin, Eugene"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "89", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "SILV 504", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

Next, we track the relationship between knowledge and vision through Renaissance painting, the 19th-century urbanism of light and glass, and the politics of spectacle and surveillance.

{"course_name": "First-Year Writing Seminar: Working", "description": "Visible and invisible, lonesome and collaborative, inspired and endured, labor makes and maintains the world we live in. To learn about work is to learn how most people spend most of the day, securing means, pursuing dreams, existing in active relation to other people\u2014whether spreadsheeting or ship-breaking, trading or patrolling, composing or caretaking. How do we come to choose the work we do, and how to navigate the seeming injustices that come with the division of labor? What are the ethical and economic ties that bind us to the faraway strangers, or half-familiars we greet everyday, whose strenuous productivity we benefit from? How have art and literature depicted working people, and when does work go undepicted? What difference does work make for our notions and experience of time? Through topics such as globalization, class, migration, slavery, and unemployment, and genres like pastoral and documentary, this course explores the challenges that work has posed to political thought, political action, and aesthetic representation alike. Readings span fiction, oral history, poetry, philosophy, and art criticism. Films and a field trip or two will supplement the readings.\n\r      ", "classification": "FIRST-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO GALLATIN FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS ONLY.", "instructors": ["Ding, Chinnie", "Ding, Chinnie"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "377", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 601", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: The Chains of Command: Authority and Obedience", "description": "What do we really mean when we talk about \u201cauthority,\u201d and why do we obey it? This semester we will examine the decision to obey or disobey and the pleasures and agonies that come with following the rules and with breaking them. Across a range of literary, philosophical, political theoretical, and psychoanalytic texts, we will examine the authority figures behind the rules, those who decide to follow them (or not), and the bystanders around them. We will ask how different disciplines grapple with the challenge of authority and obedience\u2014for instance, how political theory imagines the \u201csovereign,\u201d how literature erects archetypes of temptation, and how psychoanalysis imagines the prohibitions we carry within ourselves. We will also track these tropes and figures through history, asking how the rules, the rulers, and the ruled change over time (and how and why they might). How do our ideas about what constitutes obedience and disobedience shift? When we enter into a relationship (or a culture!) with foundational rules and preconditions, how does this enable, diminish or, some might suggest, even destroy our freedom? And what happens when the promises we\u2019ve made conflict with each other and make it impossible to obey one command without disobeying another? Our readings will include, in addition to earlier and later works, Immanuel Kant\u2019s \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?,\u201d Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s The Social Contract, Charles Perrault\u2019s \u201cBluebeard,\u201d Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s The Wrongs of Woman, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s Fear and Trembling, and Sigmund Freud\u2019s Totem and Taboo.\n\r      ", "classification": "FIRST-UG", "grading": "Ugrd Gallatin Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '2.00 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "OPEN TO GALLATIN FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS ONLY.\n\nInstructor: Andrea Gadberry", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "91", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Gallatin School of Individualized Study", "location": "1WP 401", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
