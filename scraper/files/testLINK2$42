We'll examine the shifting intellectual parameters and political interventions of American Studies scholarship over the past half century, in the US and globally, then focus on the kind of work produced within our NYU program specifically. We'll address questions including: What theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches have shaped the field? How has the field intersected with other institutionally insurgent interdisciplinary fields, including (but not limited to) feminist and queer studies, labor studies, comparative ethnic and diaspora studies, environmental studies and dis/ability studies?", "instructors": ["Duggan, Elizabeth"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "3301", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "BOBS LL138", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

We begin with early critiques of imperialist domination and racialization (Marx, Lenin, DuBois, CLR James, Eric Williams), move through anti-colonial and nationalist movements of the sixties and seventies (Carmichael and Hamilton, AIM, Aztl\u00e1n, Red Guard, Chin, Forbes, Cesaire, Cabral, Retamar, Fanon, Guevara) and the world systems theory and dependency models of mid-century (Wallerstein, Amin, Cardoso, Fanon, Memmi, Ngugi, Blauner, Mari\u00e1tegui). Finally, we will consider the critique of the failure of decolonization\u2014of nationalist thought and independence movements\u2014that has generated Post-Colonial theory and Critical Race theory in their contemporary guise (Said, Ahmad, Guha, Chatterjee, Nandy, Spivak, Bhabha, Moreiras, Coronil, Davis, Baker, Anzald\u00faa, Moraga, Alarc\u00f3n, Sald\u00edvar, Rafael, Lowe, Lloyd, JanMohamed, Omi and Winant, Sharpe, Moten, Viego, Eng, Edwards, Hartman, Salda\u00f1a, Warrior, Byrd).

In this course we will study contemporary diasporas in historical and transnational perspective, with special interest in the long complex history and theorization of the African diaspora and its ramifications in present-day political and cultural life. After a study of the theoretical issues and debates concerning transnational social formations and interactions we will then turn to an overview of the varieties and changing contexts of diaspora experience.  A major focus will be on Afro-Caribbean migrations and diasporas in the United States.  Readings and discussion will address the economic and political grounding of diasporic experience in global and regional migration and community formation, though primary attention will go to the cultural dimensions of these experiences.   Of special interest will be dynamics of transnational cultural flows, new forms of transculturation, and the development of hybrid social and cultural identities. Readings will be from the work of such thinkers as Stuart Hall, Paul Gilroy, Saskia Sassen, Benedict Anderson, Arjun Appadurai, Robin Cohen, Brent Edwards, James Clifford, Rey Chow, and Earl Lewis.  Seminar participants will share their work on specific diaspora experiences or pertinent theoretical and research issues.", "instructors": ["Flores, Juan"], "component": "Colloquium", "number": "3701", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "20CS 4CONF", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
