{"course_name": "Debates in Modern Irish History", "description": "Debates in Modern Irish History \r\nThis course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import.  It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization\n\r      ", "classification": "EURO-GA", "grading": "GSAS Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '3.30 PM', 'end': '6.00 PM', 'day': 'Tue'}]", "notes": "SAME AS IRISH-GA 1421, HIST-GA 1421, & DRAP-GA 1426.", "instructors": ["Lee, John"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "1421", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "Graduate School of Arts and Science", "location": "ERIN 101", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}

It has, moreover, attempted to ensure protection for all citizens, not just the unfortunate, against a broad palette of natural and social risks.
