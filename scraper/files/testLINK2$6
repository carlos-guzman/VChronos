In this broad survey of late sixteenth and early seventeenth century English drama exclusive of Shakespeare, we will read a range of plays within their generic and social contexts.  In the introductory weeks, we will study two exemplary Elizabethan dramas that both define, and defy, common conceptions about tragedy and comedy and the differences between these genres.  The first section of the course includes five lively comedies.  We will emphasize their city settings and their often satirical depiction of middle class life, gender, and sexuality.  In the second part of the course, we\u2019ll refine our definition of tragedy by pitting the code of revenge that drives many of these tragic plays against the aristocratic and romantic ideals that also possess their male and female characters.  The course is roughly chronological in its choice of plays.  Thus, the development of each genre from Elizabethan to Jacobean times will guide our reading, but we will also consider how comedy and tragedy were often mixed together throughout the period from the 1580s through to the 1620s.  We will read about one play a week and some introductory essays; assignments include 2 ten-page papers and 2 exams. The textbook is: David Bevington, ed.

As King James succeeded Queen Elizabeth, Shakespeare and his acting company coped with the evolving tastes and changing concerns of the London audience. The Gunpowder Plot to blow up the King in his new Parliament marked the delayed start of a new century. Political violence, competing religious ideas, crime and criminality, new roles for women, the nature of kingship, racial difference and the prospect of empire were all part of the Jacobean scene. Shakespeare adapted the main dramatic genres of comedy and tragedy to address his time, and he helped invent tragicomedy to accommodate its strange mixture of anxiety and confidence.

The first phase is largely historical and theoretical, while the latter mainly deals with hands-on filmmaking. Students document various aspects of Asian/Pacific American communities in New York? sociocultural and political issues surrounding them, histories, personal stories, geodynamics of ethnic localities, domestic lives, professions, ethnic festivals and performances, etc. At the end of the course, students have made at least two collective documentaries (10 to 12 minutes each), which may be interrelated or on entirely different subjects.", "instructors": ["Lee, Sharon"], "component": "Lecture", "number": "309", "loc_code": "WS", "session": {"start": "09/02/2014", "end": "12/12/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "College of Arts and Science", "location": "SILV 512", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
