Why do combinations of certain features in offspring translate into specific characteristics that either enhance or diminish the organism\u2019s fitness? Answers to questions such as these fall partly within the discipline of genetics,\r\nwhich is the study of heredity. Principles from the Foundations of Science curriculum provide a framework for learning about classical genetics, chromosome structure and mutation, gene function and regulation, and aspects of molecular and developmental genetics. Recent studies in human\r\ngenetics and their applications, particularly to health-related issues, are also investigated.\n\r      ", "classification": "BIOL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Tue'}, {'start': '9.15 AM', 'end': '10.30 AM', 'day': 'Thu'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Idaghdour, Youssef", "Idaghdour, Youssef"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "214", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Biology Capstone Seminar", "description": "The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD biologists and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research Students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the  junior year; it will be offered every semester.\n\r      ", "classification": "BIOL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '7.30 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "390", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Applied Molecular Biology", "description": "Molecular biology has revolutionized biological research during the past few decades and has formed the basis for all high-throughput and genomics technologies. This course combines lecture, class discussions, and lab experiments to explore applications of molecular biology in modern biological research, particularly highthroughput biology and genomics. The course\nengages students in a guided research project to learn basics and advanced high-throughput molecular biology techniques, as well as scientific writing and data reporting. In particular, students carry out high-throughput cloning and sequencing of a set of several hundred DNAs that encode transcription/chromatin factors from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results are analyzed to assess cloning success, accuracy of gene annotation and gene expression under specific growth conditions.\n\r      ", "classification": "BIOL-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '2.10 PM', 'end': '6.40 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Salehi-Ashtiani, Kourosh", " Koussa, Joseph"], "component": "Laboratory", "number": "211", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
