{"course_name": "Introduction to Computer Science", "description": "Computer Science is an innovative and exciting field that focuses on producing efficient solutions (Algorithms) and solving problems in any field. This course introduces students to the foundations of computer science. Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs using a high-level programming language. The course covers core programming concepts including: basic computation; data\nstructure; control structure; iterative structures; file I/O and exception handling; recursion, sorting, searching, and functions. Students also learn the elements of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), such as objects, classes, inheritance,\nabstraction, polymorphism, and interface. OOP is a programming paradigm used to solve complex systems. Students produce programs focusing on\nscientific concepts, graphics, games, and web CGI implementation. Students design, test, and develop innovative software applications such as\ngames, interactive websites, and other projects related to different fields. In a final project, they develop a fully functioning, interactive, fun game that employs a clean design, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), simple to moderate strategy, and event-handling techniques.\n\r      ", "classification": "CS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '12.45 PM', 'end': '3.15 PM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "101", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Operating Systems", "description": "A digital computer consists of hardware and software that users employ to solve problems in a wide variety of applications. The operating system in a computer is a collection of software that functions as the chief manager that oversees the\ninteractions between the user, the applications, the software and the hardware, and is responsible for scheduling the many tasks involved, in an efficient and user-friendly manner. This course covers high-level design of key operating system concepts such as process scheduling and synchronization; concurrency, deadlocks and their prevention; memory management, including (demand) paging and segmentation; and I/O and file systems. Students learn about the design and implementation of the operating systems that run on your personal computers and smartphones. This is a hands-on course where students implement (in C, C++, Java, or C#) operating system components like those found in Windows, UNIX/Linux, and Androidl.\n\r      ", "classification": "CS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Mon'}, {'start': '10.40 AM', 'end': '11.55 AM', 'day': 'Wed'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": ["Abouzied, Azza", "Abouzied, Azza"], "component": "Seminar", "number": "106", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
{"course_name": "Computer Science Capstone Seminar", "description": "The capstone seminar provides students with an overview of the diverse multidisciplinary research areas that have captured the interest and fascination of NYUAD computer scientists and others in related fields. Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.  Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.\n\r      ", "classification": "CS-AD", "grading": "Ugrd Abu Dhabi Graded", "class_name": "", "meet_data": "[{'start': '5.00 PM', 'end': '7.30 PM', 'day': 'Sun'}]", "notes": "", "instructors": [], "component": "Seminar", "number": "390", "loc_code": "AD", "session": {"start": " 08/31/201", "end": " 12/14/2014", "day": ""}, "college": "NYU Abu Dhabi", "location": "", "units": "4", "is_open": true, "section": "001"}
