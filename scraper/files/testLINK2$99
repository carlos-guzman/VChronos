Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It\nled to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public\u2019s everyday experiences and intuition.

But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial.

The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers.  Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.

When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy.
